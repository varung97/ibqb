<p class="p1">The idea of &ldquo;reflux&rdquo; was usually given for the production of ethanoic acid in (a) but ethanal was less clear. We accept that perhaps we should have phrased (a) (ii), &ldquo;Determine the <em>average </em>oxidation number of carbon in &hellip;&rdquo; In practice, this was one of the best answered parts and caused few difficulties. Few had any idea how to attempt the half-equation in (iii) and the overall equation in (iv). Although the mechanism in (b) has been set on numerous occasions, candidates are still not taking care over the start and finish of the curly arrows and the intermediate is drawn poorly. It must have partial bonds and the sign must be outside the square brackets. Some candidates offered an \({{\text{S}}_{\text{N}}}{\text{1}}\) mechanism. In (c) (ii), the orders were usually successfully deduced but many omitted to give the overall rate expression. In part (ii), quite a number of candidates unaccountably ignored the instruction and used any experiment but No 3. The units were frequently wrong or omitted. The molecularity was answered satisfactorily. In (d), candidates frequently stated that the molecules have mirror images but not that these mirror images are non-superposable. &ldquo;Chiral&rdquo; was a popular correct answer. There seemed to be little understanding of a polarimeter with some suggesting that the crystals themselves rotate. In (e) the equations were poor and few were able to identify the reagent. Most descriptions in (f) would have been improved with a careful and clear diagram. Part (g), the relative abundance of \(^{{\text{79}}}{\text{Br}}\) was well done except by those who tried to do it &ldquo;by inspection&rdquo;; this usually led to the wrong answer.</p>
