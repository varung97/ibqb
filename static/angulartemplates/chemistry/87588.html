<p>There appeared to be some significant gaps in knowledge within this question, the various parts either scored very well or not at all.</p>
<p>In a(ii) there was a poor understanding of the nature of bonding in aluminium chloride and aluminium oxide. Candidates are still confusing electrical conductivity in compounds with that in metals, and often refer to the inability to conduct being down to a lack of mobile electrons in compounds.</p>
<p>Balancing equations, both full, as in parts a(i) and a(iii), and half equations as in b(ii), showed poor knowledge both of the reactants and products and in the ability to balance them in both atoms and charge. It should be expected that higher level candidates would be comfortable with these processes. The ability to deduce and predict what they would see during a reaction is a skill required of all chemists, it was missing in the attempts to answer b(ii). Parts c and d(i), (ii) and (iii) showed good knowledge, but in part d(iv) the understanding of the acid nature of some d block complex ions was lacking. Part e was rarely given credit, as many appeared to misread the question, and discussed the changes in first ionisation energies across Period 3.</p>

The ability to deduce and predict what they would see during a reaction is a skill required of all chemists, it was missing in the attempts to answer b(ii). Parts c and d(i), ii) and iii) showed good knowledge, but in part d(iv) the understanding of the acid nature of some d block complex ions was lacking. Part e was rarely given credit, as many appeared to misread the question, and discussed the changes in first ionisation energies across Period 3.</p>
