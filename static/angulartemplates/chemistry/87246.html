<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p>A student carried out an experiment to determine the concentration of a hydrochloric acid solution and the enthalpy change of the reaction between aqueous sodium hydroxide and this acid by thermometric titration.</p>
<p>She added \({\text{5.0 c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) portions of hydrochloric acid to \({\text{25.0 c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of \({\text{1.00 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) sodium hydroxide solution in a glass beaker until the total volume of acid added was \({\text{50.0 c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\), measuring the temperature of the mixture each time. Her results are plotted in the graph below.</p>

<p>Some teachers commented that thermometric titrations are not listed in the syllabus nor are they included as prescribed experiments for the new guide. A similar question was asked in a past examination and thermometric titrations are covered in Topic 5. The intention is that any data based questions should be accessible to all students, who have the appropriate practical experience. It is not intended that such questions will be constrained to experiments on this list. Most candidates were not able to access the first mark with by construction of lines of best fit. Some drew a 'dot to dot' curve, but with most just providing a construction line dropping down from the maximum point on the graph, which did allow them to access the second mark. There was some transferred error for 1aii), but many were not able to carry out the calculation. Scoring for the temperature difference was dependent upon on the candidate's annotations, with a few extending the line of best fit back to the y axis. In the calculation of enthalpy change, the total mass of the solutions was often incorrect, but some salvaged the subsequent marks. The calculation of percentage error was generally done well, but a good third of the candidates failed to read the question stem and did not give the answer to two significant figures. The concept of heat loss in the experiment was well understood, but the solution was very often too vague.</p>
