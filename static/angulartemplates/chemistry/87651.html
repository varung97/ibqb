<p>Though it was the least popular question on the paper, it was still answered, though not very well, by a significant number of students. Correct responses to the colour change required in the first part were rare, though more students could write an appropriate equation and outline why the reaction occurred, even though this was often phrased in terms of electronegativity, rather than reactivity or electrode potential. In part (b) many students seemed to be aware of the difference between strong and weak acids, but few could use this to answer the question asked and frequently, even having displayed this knowledge, were unable to write an equation for the required reaction in water. Unfortunately changes in pagination meant that the phrase &ldquo;<em>the equilibrium above</em>&rdquo; in part (b) (iii) may have confused candidates with regard to which particular equilibrium the question referred to. Fortunately both of the equilibria that it could have referred to change in the same direction and students scored well on this, and both would eventually result in the release of chlorine, that a number recognized as a toxic gas. In contrast to Question 1, many students could correctly identify the hydrogen bonding, resulting from the &ndash;OH group, as being the reason for the solubility of HOCl in water. An encouraging number of students gained full marks for calculating the pH of the buffer, usually by memorizing the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and substituting in this. An even greater number of students could accurately explain the mode of action of acid-base indicators. In part (c) very few students could write, much less combine, appropriate half equations, even though the reactants and products were given, but far more could correctly deduce the oxidation numbers of the species involved. In the final part most students had some general idea of what a standard electrode potential was, but in many cases the definitions lacked the detail required. Quite a few students correctly deduced that the oxidation of chromium(III) to dichromate(VI) was energetically feasible and give valid reasons to support this.</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>Though it was the least popular question on the paper, it was still answered, though not very well, by a significant number of students. Correct responses to the colour change required in the first part were rare, though more students could write an appropriate equation and outline why the reaction occurred, even though this was often phrased in terms of electronegativity, rather than reactivity or electrode potential. In part (b) many students seemed to be aware of the difference between strong and weak acids, but few could use this to answer the question asked and frequently, even having displayed this knowledge, were unable to write an equation for the required reaction in water. Unfortunately changes in pagination meant that the phrase &ldquo;<em>the equilibrium above</em>&rdquo; in part (b) (iii) may have confused candidates with regard to which particular equilibrium the question referred to. Fortunately both of the equilibria that it could have referred to change in the same direction and students scored well on this, and both would eventually result in the release of chlorine, that a number recognized as a toxic gas. In contrast to Question 1, many students could correctly identify the hydrogen bonding, resulting from the &ndash;OH group, as being the reason for the solubility of HOCl in water.
