<p>A population of \(200\) rabbits was introduced to an island. One week later the number of rabbits was \(210\). The number of rabbits, \(N\) , can be modelled by the function</p>
<p>\[N(t) = 200 \times {b^t},\,\,t \geqslant 0\,,\]</p>
<p>where \(t\) is the time, in weeks, since the rabbits were introduced to the island.</p>
<p>Find the value of \(b\) .</p>
