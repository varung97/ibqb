<p>Prachi is on vacation in the United States. She is visiting the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p><br>When she reaches the top, she drops a coin down a cliff. The coin falls down a distance of \(5\) metres during the first second, \(15\) metres during the next second, \(25\) metres during the third second and continues in this way. The distances that the coin falls during each second forms an arithmetic sequence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(i)     Write down the common difference, \(d\) , of this arithmetic sequence.</p>
<p>(ii)    Write down the distance the coin falls during the fourth second.</p>
