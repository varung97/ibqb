<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p>Sergei is training to be a weightlifter. Each day he trains at the local gym by lifting a metal bar that has heavy weights attached. He carries out successive lifts. After each lift, the same amount of weight is <strong>added</strong> to the bar to increase the weight to be lifted.</p>
<p>The weights of each of Sergei&rsquo;s lifts form an arithmetic sequence.</p>
<p>Sergei&rsquo;s friend, Yuri, records the weight of each lift. Unfortunately, last Monday, Yuri misplaced all but two of the recordings of Sergei&rsquo;s lifts.</p>
<p>On that day, Sergei lifted 21 kg on the third lift and 46 kg on the eighth lift.</p>
