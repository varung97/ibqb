<div class='specification'>
<p>Jashanti is saving money to buy a car. The price of the car, in US Dollars (USD), can be modelled by the equation</p>
<p>\[P = 8500{\text{ }}{(0.95)^t}.\]</p>
<p>Jashanti&rsquo;s savings, in USD, can be modelled by the equation</p>
<p>\[S = 400t + 2000.\]</p>
<p>In both equations \(t\) is the time in months since Jashanti started saving for the car.</p>
