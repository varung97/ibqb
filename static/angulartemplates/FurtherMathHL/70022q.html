<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='question'>
<p>Sarah is the quality control manager for the Stronger Steel Corporation which makes steel sheets. The steel sheets should have a mean tensile strength of 430 MegaPascals (MPa). If the mean tensile strength drops to 400 MPa, then Sarah must recommend a change in composition. The tensile strength of these steel sheets follows a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 35 MPa. Sarah defines the following hypotheses</p>
<p>\[{H_0}:\mu&nbsp; = 430\]</p>
<p>\[{H_1}:\mu&nbsp; = 400\]</p>
<p>where \(\mu \) denotes the mean tensile strength in MPa. She takes a random sample of \(n\) steel sheets and defines the critical region as \(\bar x \leqslant k\), where \(\bar x\) notes the mean tensile strength of the sample in MPa and \(k\) is a constant.</p>
<p>Given that the \(P{\text{(Type I Error)}} = 0.0851\) and \(P{\text{(Type II Error)}} = 0.115\), both correct to three significant figures, find the value of \(k\) and the value of \(n\).</p>
