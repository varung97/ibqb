<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='question'>
<p class="p1">Consider the curve C given by \(y = {x^3}\).</p>
<p class="p1">The tangent at a point <span class="s1">P </span>on \(C\) meets the curve again at <span class="s1">Q</span>. The tangent at <span class="s1">Q </span>meets the curve again at <span class="s1">R</span>. Denote the \(x\)-coordinates of \({\text{P, Q}}\) and <span class="s1">R</span>, by \({x_1},{\text{ }}{x_2}\) and \({x_3}\) respectively where \({x_1} \ne 0\). Show that, \({x_1},{\text{ }}{x_2},{\text{ }}{x_3}\) form the first three elements of a divergent geometric sequence.</p>
