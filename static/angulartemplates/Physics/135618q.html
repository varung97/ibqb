<p>A spectral line in the hydrogen spectrum measured in the laboratory today has a wavelength of 21cm. Since the emission of the CMB radiation, the cosmic scale factor has changed by a factor of 1100. Determine the wavelength of the 21cm spectral line in the CMB radiation when it is observed today.</p>
