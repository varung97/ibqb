<p>in method 1 the perpendicular distance varies from 0 to a maximum value, in method 2 this distance is constant at the maximum value<br /><em><strong>OR<br /></strong></em>angle between <em>F</em> and <em>r</em> is 90&deg; in method 2 and less in method 1<br /><em><strong>OR<br /></strong>&Gamma;</em> = <em>F</em> &times; perpendicular distance</p>
<p>perpendicular distance/ torque is greater in method 2</p>
