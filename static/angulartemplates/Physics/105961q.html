<div class='question'>
<p class="p1">(i) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>State the meanings of \(Q\) and \(W\).</p>
<p class="p1">\(Q\):</p>
<p class="p1">\(W\):</p>
<p class="p1">(ii) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>Describe how the first law of thermodynamics applies in the operation of the heat exchanger.</p>
<p class="p1">(iii) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>Discuss the entropy changes that take place in the gas and in the surroundings.</p>
