<p>A fire engine is travelling at a constant velocity towards a stationary observer. Its siren emits a note of constant frequency. As the engine passes close to the observer, the frequency of the note perceived by the observer decreases. Explain this decrease in terms of the wavefronts of the note emitted by the siren.</p>
