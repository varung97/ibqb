<p>(i) this is the value of density for which the universe will begin to contract after an infinite amount of time;<br /><em>Do not accept &ldquo;density at which universe is flat&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p>(ii) if the density of the universe is less than the critical density it will continue expanding forever;<br />if the density is greater than the critical density then it will after a certain amount of time begin to contract;<br />the behaviour of galaxies suggests that there is more matter in the universe than is actually observed; { <em>(allow other relevant</em> <em>comment about</em> <em>dark matter)</em><br />without knowing the mass of this matter the density cannot be determined;</p>
