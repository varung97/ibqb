<p>(i) electrons are moving at right angles to the magnetic field;<br />electrons experience a force directed along the rod / charge is separated in&nbsp;the rod;<br />the work done by this force to achieve this separation leads to an induced<br />emf;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) the product of magnitude of field strength and the rate at which the area is&nbsp;swept out by the rod is changing / the rate at which the rod cuts through&nbsp;field lines;</p>

<p>(ii) Lenz&rsquo;s law states that the direction of the induced emf/current is such as to&nbsp;oppose the change producing it;<br />there is a current in the rod due to the induced emf;<br />the force on the current/rod due to the magnetic field is in the opposite&nbsp;direction to the force producing the motion of the rod;</p>
