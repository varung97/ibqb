<p>a frame of reference accelerating in outer space is equivalent to a frame of reference at rest in a gravitational field / an inertial frame of reference in outer space is equivalent to a freely falling frame of reference in a (uniform) gravitational field; <br /><em>Award <strong>[0]</strong> for only &ldquo;gravitational and inertial mass are equivalent&rdquo;.</em></p>

<p>(i) light source appears to be moving away from the observer;<br />so there is a red-shift (according to the Doppler effect);</p>
<p><em><strong>or</strong></em></p>
<p>spaceship (by equivalence) can be regarded as (at rest) in a gravitational field;<br />photons lose energy in reaching observer (so frequency must be reduced);</p>
<p>(ii) the planet has a gravitational field;<br />so (by equivalence) the situation is as though light source is near a planet;<br /><em>f</em> is still observed to be less than&nbsp; <em>f</em><sub>0</sub> / period of the light can be taken as unit of time;<br />this can be interpreted as an increase in the time for emission of one wavelength / increase in the period (<em>ie</em> time is dilated);</p>
