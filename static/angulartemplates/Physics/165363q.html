<p>In the proton&ndash;proton cycle, four hydrogen nuclei fuse to produce one nucleus of helium releasing a total of 4.3 &times; 10<sup>&ndash;12</sup> J of energy. The Sun will spend 10<sup>10</sup> years on the&nbsp;main sequence. It may be assumed that during this time the Sun maintains a constant luminosity of 3.8 &times; 10<sup>26</sup> W.</p>
<p><br />Show that the total mass of hydrogen that is converted into helium while the Sun is on the main sequence is 2 &times; 10<sup>29</sup> kg.</p>
