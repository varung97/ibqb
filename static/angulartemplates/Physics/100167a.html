<p><em>internal energy:</em><br />total energy of component particles (in the human);<br />comprises potential energy + (random) kinetic energy;</p>
<p><em>temperature:</em><br />measure of average kinetic energy of particles;<br />indicates direction of (natural) flow of thermal energy;<br />internal energy measured in J and temperature measured in K/&deg;C ; <em>(both needed) </em>{<em>(accept alternative suitable units)</em></p>
