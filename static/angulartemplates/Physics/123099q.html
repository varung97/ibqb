<p>The electron is detected at a distance of 0.800 m from the emitting nucleus as measured in the laboratory.</p>
<p>(i) For the reference frame of the electron, calculate the distance travelled by the detector.</p>
<p>(ii) For the reference frame of the laboratory, calculate the time taken for the electron to reach the detector after its emission from the nucleus.</p>
<p>(iii) For the reference frame of the electron, calculate the time between its emission at the nucleus and its detection.</p>
<p>(iv) Outline why the answer to (b)(iii) represents a proper time interval.</p>
