<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>(i) use of area within cycle;<br />each large square has work value of 250 (J);<br />estimate (16 x 250= )4000 (J); (allow 3600 &minus; 4100)<br /><em>Award <strong>[3]</strong> for same outcome with small squares of area 10 (J). </em></p>
<p>(ii) (work is done by the gas because) area under expansion is greater than that under compression/pressure during expansion is greater than during compression;</p>
<p>(iii) clear attempt to compare two <em>PV</em> values;<br />evaluate two <em>PV</em> values correctly <em>eg</em> 75 x 80= 6000 and 200 x 30= 6000; &nbsp;</p>
<p>(iv) use of <em>PV</em> =<em>nRT</em> or equivalent;<br />1350/1330 (K);</p>
<p>(v) both changes are isochoric/isovolumetric/constant volume changes;<br />B: temperature/internal energy increases, D: temperature/internal energy decreases;<br />B: thermal energy/heat input (to system), D: thermal energy/heat output (from system);<br />B: pressure increases, D: pressure decreases;</p>
