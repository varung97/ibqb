<p>This question is about a tidal power station.</p>
<p>A tidal power station is built for a coastal town. Sea water is stored in a tidal basin behind a dam at high tide and released in a controlled manner between high tides, so that it passes through turbines to generate electricity.</p>
<p>The following data are available.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Difference between high and low tide water level = 1.8m<br />Density of sea water = 1.1&times;10<sup>3</sup>kgm<sup>&ndash;3</sup><br />Surface area of basin = 1.4&times;10<sup>5</sup>m<sup>2</sup><br />Overall efficiency of power station = 24%</p>
