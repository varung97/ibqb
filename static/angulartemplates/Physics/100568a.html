<p>inertial and gravitational effects are indistinguishable / a freely falling frame in a gravitational field is equivalent to an inertial frame far from all masses / an accelerating frame is equivalent to a frame at rest in a gravitational field;</p>

<p>(i) <em>The question does not specifically state the location of the tower so allow any of the explanations below.</em><br />(the principle of equivalence predicts) photon energy decreases as it moves against a <em>g</em> field;<br />this energy is given by <em>E</em>=<em>hf</em>;<br />hence as <em>E</em> decreases, <em>f</em> must also decrease;</p>
<p><em><strong>or</strong></em></p>
<p>the tower is equivalent to a frame accelerating upwards;<br />the top of the tower is moving away from the light emitted from the base;<br />and so by the Doppler effect/red-shift the frequency at the top will be less;</p>
<p><em><strong>or</strong></em></p>
<p>in freely falling tower the frequency at the top and bottom would be the same;<br />an outside observer sees the top moving towards the light emitted from the base and so (by the Doppler effect) expects a blue-shift;<br />for the frequency to be the same at the top the light moving upwards must suffer an equal red-shift;</p>
<p>(ii) 8.8&times;10<sup>3</sup>Hz / 8.9&times;10<sup>3</sup>Hz / 9.0&times;10<sup>3</sup>Hz;</p>
<p>(iii) \(\frac{{\Delta f}}{f}\left( { = \frac{{8.8 \times {{10}^3}}}{{3.5 \times {{10}^{18}}}}} \right) \approx {10^{ - 15}}\) / the shift is very small compared to the original&nbsp; frequency / the new frequency differs from the original in the 15th decimal place;</p>
