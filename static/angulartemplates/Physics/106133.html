<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">This question is about a Galilean transformation and time dilation.</p>
<p class="p1">Ben is in a spaceship that is travelling in a straight-line with constant speed <em>v </em>as measured by Jill who is in a space station.</p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../../../../../../ib-questionbank-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/tinymce_asset/asset/3072/Schermafbeelding_2016-11-10_om_10.33.50.png" alt="N10/4/PHYSI/HP3/ENG/TZ0/H1" /></p>
<p class="p1">Ben switches on a light pulse that bounces vertically (as observed by Ben) between two horizontal mirrors \({{\text{M}}_{\text{1}}}\) and \({{\text{M}}_{\text{2}}}\) separated by a distance \(d\). At the instant that the mirrors are opposite Jill, the pulse is just leaving the mirror \({{\text{M}}_{\text{2}}}\). The speed of light in air is \(c\).</p>

<div class='question'>
<p class="p1">The questions (e) and (f ) introduce the concepts of time dilation and length contraction. Discuss how muon decay in the atmosphere provides experimental evidence for these concepts.</p>

<p class="p1"><em>Look for these main points however expressed.</em></p>
<p class="p1">muons produced in the upper atmosphere have speeds close to \(c\);</p>
<p class="p1">many such muons are observed reaching the surface of Earth;</p>
<p class="p1">the half-life as measured in a muon&rsquo;s frame of reference does not give time for many to reach Earth / means many will have decayed in travelling to Earth;</p>
<p class="p1">but the contracted length of the journey/length as measured in a muon&rsquo;s reference frame means there is sufficient time;</p>
<p class="p1">and the dilated time/time measured by Earth observer is also sufficient for muons to reach the surface;</p>
