<p>One of the lines in the spectrum of atomic hydrogen has a frequency of 4.6&times;10<sup>16</sup>Hz as measured in the laboratory. The same line in the spectrum of star X is observed on Earth to be shifted by 1.3&times;10<sup>12</sup>Hz.</p>
<p>(i) State the direction of the observed frequency shift.</p>
<p>(ii) Determine the speed at which X is moving towards Earth stating any assumption that you have made.</p>

<p>The star X has a companion star Y. The distance from Earth to the stars is 1.0&times;10<sup>18</sup>m. The images of X and Y are just resolved according to the Rayleigh criterion by a telescope on Earth with a circular eyepiece lens of diameter 5.0&times;10<sup>&ndash;2</sup>m.</p>
<p>(i) State what is meant by the statement &ldquo;just resolved according to the Rayleigh criterion&rdquo;.</p>
<p>(ii) The average wavelength of the light emitted by the stars is 4.8&times;10<sup>&ndash;7</sup>m. Determine the separation of X and Y.</p>
