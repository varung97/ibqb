<p>Theoretical studies indicate that the universe may be open, closed or flat.</p>
<p>(i) State, by reference to critical density, the condition that must be satisfied for the universe to be flat.</p>
<p>(ii) In a flat universe, the rate of expansion would be slowing down. Suggest a reason for this.</p>
<p>(iii) Outline why it has been difficult to determine whether the universe is open, closed or flat.</p>

<p>(i) a universe whose density is equal to the critical density;</p>
<p>(ii) the mutual gravitational attraction would slow the expansion down;</p>
<p>(iii) the density of the universe needs to be determined;<br />this involves many uncertainties related to measurement of distances/volume;<br />this involves many uncertainties related to presence of dark matter;</p>

<p>light from galaxies is observed to be red-shifted/to have a longer wavelength than that emitted;<br />indicating that the distance between galaxies is getting bigger/galaxies move away from each other/from us;<br /><em>Award <strong>[1 max]</strong> if galaxies are not mentioned.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>or</strong></em></p>
<p>the presence of the cosmic microwave background radiation;<br />is evidence of cooling of the universe/increase in wavelength/red-shift due to expansion;</p>
