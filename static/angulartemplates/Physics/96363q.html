<p>In a simple model of the hydrogen atom, the electron can be regarded as being in a&nbsp;circular orbit about the proton. The radius of the orbit is 2.0&times;10<sup>&ndash;10 </sup>m.</p>
<p>(i) Determine the magnitude of the electric force between the proton and the electron.</p>
<p>(ii) Calculate the magnitude of the electric field strength <em>E</em> and state the direction of&nbsp;the electric field due to the proton at a distance of 2.0&times;10<sup>&ndash;10</sup> m from the proton.</p>
<p>(iii) The magnitude of the gravitational field due to the proton at a distance of&nbsp;2.0&times;10<sup>&ndash;10</sup> m from the proton is <em>H.</em><br />Show that the ratio&nbsp;\(\frac{H}{E}\) is of the order 10<sup>&ndash;28</sup>C kg<sup>&ndash;1</sup>.</p>
<p>(iv) The orbital electron is transferred from its orbit to a point where the potential&nbsp;is zero. The gain in potential energy of the electron is 5.4&times;10<sup>&ndash;19</sup>J. Calculate the&nbsp;value of the potential difference through which the electron is moved.</p>

<p>An electric cell is a device that is used to transfer energy to electrons in a circuit. A particular circuit consists of a cell of emf <em>&epsilon;</em> and internal resistance <em>r</em> connected in series with a resistor of resistance 5.0 &Omega;.</p>
<p>(i) Define<em> emf of a cell.</em></p>
<p>(ii) The energy supplied by the cell to one electron in transferring it around the circuit&nbsp;is 5.1&times;10<sup>&ndash;19</sup>J. Show that the emf of the cell is 3.2V.</p>
<p>(iii) Each electron in the circuit transfers an energy of 4.0&times;10<sup>&ndash;19</sup> J to the 5.0 &Omega; resistor.&nbsp;Determine the value of the internal resistance <em>r.</em></p>
