<p>The radio signals from two stars on opposite sides of the galaxy are detected on Earth&nbsp;using a radio telescope. The telescope has a circular receiving dish.</p>
<p>(i) State the Rayleigh criterion for the images of two point sources to be just resolved.</p>
<p>(ii) The galaxy is 2.0&times;10<sup>21</sup>m from Earth and the stars are separated by 5.0&times;10<sup>19</sup>m.&nbsp;Determine the minimum size of the telescope dish required to resolve the images of&nbsp;the two stars at a wavelength of 5.1&times;10<sup>&ndash;2</sup>m.</p>
