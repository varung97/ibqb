<p>(i) total wind power required \( = \frac{{750000}}{{0.3}}\);</p>
<p>maximum wind power required per turbine, \(P = \frac{{750000}}{{5 \times 0.3}}\left( { = 500{\rm{kW}}} \right)\);</p>
<p>\(d = {\left( {\frac{{8P}}{{\rho \pi {v^3}}} = } \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}}40({\rm{m}})\)</p>
<p><em>Award<strong> [1 max]</strong> for an answer of 48.9 (m) as it indicates 5 and 0.3 ignored.</em><br /><em>Award<strong> [2 max]</strong> for 22 (m) as it indicates 0.3 ignored.</em><br /><em>Award<strong> [2 max]</strong> for 89 (m) as it indicates 5 ignored.</em></p>
<p>(ii) not all kinetic energy can be extracted from wind / losses in cables to community / turbine rotation may be cut off/&ldquo;feathered&rdquo; at high or low wind speeds;<em><br />Do not allow &ldquo;wind speed varies&rdquo; as question gives the average speed.</em></p>
<p>(iii) less kinetic energy available / wind speed less for turbines behind; turbulence/wake effect; <em>(do not allow &ldquo;turbines stacked too close&rdquo;)</em></p>
<p>(iv) <em>implications:</em> average wind speeds are greater / more space available;<br /><em>limitations:</em> installation/maintenance cost / difficulty of access / wave damage;<em><br />Must see one each for <strong>[2]</strong>.</em></p>

<p>(i) mass of coal per second (=0.0214 kg);<br />77.1 (kg);<br /><em><strong>or</strong></em><br />energy saved per hour=0.75&times;3600 (=2700MJh<sup>-1</sup>) ;</p>
<p>mass of coal saved \( = \left( {\frac{{2700}}{{35}} = } \right)77.1({\rm{kg}})\);</p>
<p><em>Award <strong>[2]</strong> for a bald correct answer.</em></p>
<p>(ii) <em>advantage:</em><br />energy is free (apart from maintenance and start-up costs) / energy is renewable / sufficient for small community with predominance of wind / supplies energy to remote community / independent of national grid / any other reasonable advantage;<br /><em>Answer must focus on wind farm not coal disadvantages.</em></p>
<p><em>disadvantage:</em><br />wind energy is variable/unpredictable / noise pollution / killing birds/bats / large open areas required / visual pollution / ecological issues / need to provide new infrastructure;</p>
<p>(iii) greenhouse gas molecules are excited by/absorbed by/resonate as a result of infrared radiations; { (must refer to infrared<br />not &ldquo;heat&rdquo;)<br />this radiation is re-emitted in all directions;<br />less greenhouse gas means less infrared/heat returned to Earth; { (consideration of return direction is essential for mark)<br />temperature falls (to reach new equilibrium);</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>energy released when a nucleus forms from constituent nucleons / (minimum) energy needed/work done to break a nucleus up into its constituent nucleons;<br /><em>Award<strong> [0]</strong> for energy to assemble nucleus.</em><br /><em>Do not allow &ldquo;particles&rdquo; or &ldquo;components&rdquo; for &ldquo;nucleons&rdquo;.</em><br /><em>Do not accept &ldquo;energy that binds nucleons together&rdquo; OWTTE.</em></p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p><em>(</em>i) generally correct shape with maximum shown, trending down to U-235;<br />maximum shown somewhere between 40 and 70; <em><br />Award <strong>[0]</strong> for straight line with positive gradient from origin.<br />Award<strong> [1]</strong> if maximum position correct but graph begins to rise or flatlines beyond or around U-235.</em></p>
<p>(ii) identifies fission as occurring at high nucleon number / at right-hand side of graph;<br />fission means that large nucleus splits into two (or more) smaller nuclei/nuclei to left of fissioning nucleus (on graph);<br />(graph shows that) fission products have higher (average) binding energy per nucleon than U-235;<br />energy released related to difference between initial and final binding energy; <em><br />Award<strong> [2 max]</strong> if no reference to graph.</em></p>

<p>(ii) time taken for number of unstable nuclei/(radio)activity to halve;<em><br />Accept atom/isotope.<br />Do not accept mass/molecule/amount/substance.</em></p>
