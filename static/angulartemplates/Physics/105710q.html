<div class='question'>
<p class="p1">In the photoelectric effect, the following observations may be made.</p>
<p class="p1">I.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The kinetic energy of the emitted electrons increases with increasing light frequency.</p>
<p class="p1">II.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The electrons are emitted without time delay.</p>
<p class="p1">Which of these observations, if any, can be explained in terms of the wave theory of light?</p>
<p class="p1">A.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither I nor II</p>
<p class="p1">B.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I and II</p>
<p class="p1">C.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I only</p>
<p class="p1">D.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;II only</p>
