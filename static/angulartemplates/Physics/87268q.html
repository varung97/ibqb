<p>An observer at rest relative to Earth observes two spaceships. Each spaceship is moving with a speed of 0.85 <em>c</em> but in opposite directions. The observer measures the rate of increase of distance between the spaceships to be 1.7 <em>c</em>. Outline whether this observation contravenes the theory of special relativity.</p>

<p>The observer on Earth in (a) watches one spaceship as it travels to a distant star at a speed of 0.85 <em>c</em>. According to observers on the spaceship, this journey takes 8.0 years.</p>
<p>(i) Calculate, according to the observer on Earth, the time taken for the journey to the star.</p>
<p>(ii) Calculate, according to the observer on Earth, the distance from Earth to the star.</p>
<p>(iii) At the instant when the spaceship passes the star, the observer on the spaceship sends a radio message to Earth. The spaceship continues to move at a speed of 0.85 <em>c</em>. Determine, according to the spaceship observer, the time taken for the message to arrive on Earth.</p>
