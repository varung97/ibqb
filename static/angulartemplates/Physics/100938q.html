<p>Potassium-40 (K-40) is a radioactive isotope that occurs naturally in many different types of rock. A very small percentage of the isotope undergoes &beta;<sup>+</sup> decay to form an isotope of argon (Ar). Construct and complete the nuclear reaction equation for this decay.</p>

<p>Overall about 10% of a sample of K-40 will decay to argon. In a particular rock sample it is found that there are 1.6&times;10<sup>22</sup> atoms of K-40 and 8.4&times;10<sup>21</sup> atoms of argon. The half-life of K-40 is 1.2&times;10<sup>9</sup> yr. Estimate the time elapsed since the rock sample was formed.</p>
