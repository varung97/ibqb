<p><em>Look for these main points:</em><br />signal from switch travels at same speed <em>c</em> to each lamp;<br />but during signal transfer C<sub>1</sub> moves closer to/C<sub>2</sub> moves away from source of signal;<br />since speed of light is independent of speed of source, signal reaches&nbsp;C<sub>1</sub> before C<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>2</sub> after C<sub>1</sub>;<br />according to Vladamir&nbsp;C<sub>1</sub> registers arrival of signal before C<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>2</sub> registers arrival of signal after C<sub>1</sub>;</p>
