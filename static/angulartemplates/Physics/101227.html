<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p>This question is about medical imaging.</p>
<p>A patient is suspected of having a partial blockage in his intestine as it leads away from his&nbsp;stomach. Possible medical imaging techniques include X-ray photography, ultrasound and the&nbsp;use of an endoscope.</p>
</div>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;'>
<p>When producing the X-ray photograph, the dose is kept to a minimum by a technique&nbsp;called enhancement.</p>
<p>(i) Outline why the dose needs to be kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>(ii) Describe <strong>one</strong> possible enhancement technique.</p>
<p>(iii) Discuss any extra procedures that are needed to get an appropriate image of the&nbsp;intestine in this situation.</p>

<p>A successful ultrasound scan relies on changes of acoustic impedance around the&nbsp;structure being imaged.</p>
<p>(i) Define <em>acoustic impedance</em>.</p>
<p>(ii) State the SI unit in which it is measured.</p>
<p>(iii) Explain, in terms of acoustic impedance, why gel needs to be applied on the surface&nbsp;of the skin before the ultrasound scan.</p>

<p>(i) X-rays cause ionisations;<br />which could cause cell damage / increased risk of cancer;</p>
<p>(ii) intensifying screen placed next to the film;<br />X-rays absorbed by screen and energy re-radiated as light to film;</p>
<p>(iii) barium meal;<br />to increase contrast between inside and outside the intestine;</p>

<p>(i) density of material&times;speed of ultrasound in material;</p>
<p>(ii) kgm<sup>&minus;2</sup>s<sup>&minus;1</sup>;</p>
<p>(iii) strong reflections take place where there is a large change in acoustic&nbsp;impedance;<br />gel eliminates air gap between source/receiver of ultrasound and skin&nbsp;surface / acoustic impedance of gel matches that of skin (and<br />source/receiver);</p>
