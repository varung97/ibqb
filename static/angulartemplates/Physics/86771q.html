<div class='question'>
<p>Two identical resistors R are connected in series to an alternating current (ac) power supply. The power supply has a root mean squared (rms) voltage of <em>V</em> and an rms current of <em>I</em>. What is the maximum power developed in <strong>one</strong> of the resistors in the circuit?</p>
<p>A. \(\sqrt 2 \) <em>VI</em></p>
<p>B. <em>VI</em></p>
<p>C. 2 <em>VI</em></p>
<p>D. \(\frac{{VI}}{{\sqrt 2 }}\)</p>
