<p>0.46 mole of an ideal monatomic gas is trapped in a cylinder. The gas has a volume of 21 m<sup>3</sup> and a pressure of 1.4 Pa.</p>
<p>(i) State how the internal energy of an ideal gas differs from that of a real gas.</p>
<p>(ii) Determine, in kelvin, the temperature of the gas in the cylinder.</p>
<p>(iii) The kinetic theory of ideal gases is one example of a scientific model. Identify <strong>two</strong> reasons why scientists find such models useful.</p>
