<p class="p1">The mass of the black hole is \(4.5 \times {10^{31}}{\text{ kg}}\). The space probe is emitting a pulse of blue light at a time interval of 1.0 seconds as measured on the space probe. The light is received by an observer on a distant space station that is stationary with respect to the space probe.</p>
