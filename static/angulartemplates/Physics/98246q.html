<p>Ionized hydrogen atoms are accelerated from rest in the vacuum between two vertical&nbsp;parallel conducting plates. The potential difference between the plates is <em>V</em>. As a result&nbsp;of the acceleration each ion gains an energy of 1.9&times;10<sup>&ndash;18</sup>J.</p>
<p>Calculate the value of <em>V</em>.</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;'>
<p>The plates in (a) are replaced by a cell that has an emf of 12.0 V and internal resistance&nbsp;5.00 &Omega;. A resistor of resistance <em>R</em> is connected in series with the cell. The energy&nbsp;transferred by the cell to an electron as it moves through the resistor is 1.44 &times;10<sup>&ndash;18</sup> J.</p>
<p>(i) Define <em>resistance</em> of a resistor.</p>
<p>(ii) Describe what is meant by internal resistance.</p>
<p>(iii) Show that the value of <em>R</em> is 15.0 &Omega;.</p>
<p>(iv) Calculate the total power supplied by the cell.</p>
