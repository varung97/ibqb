<p>(i) <em>Aldebaran</em>:<br />it forms a planetary nebula which then becomes a white dwarf;<br /><em>Betelgeuse</em>:<br />it forms a supernova which then becomes a neutron star/black hole/pulsar;&nbsp;<br /><em>To award <strong>[2]</strong> both phases are required in both responses.</em><br /><em>Award <strong>[1 max]</strong> if intermediate stages (planetary nebula, supernova) are&nbsp;omitted.</em></p>
<p>(ii) reference to 1.4 solar mass (Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarfs);<br />if Betelgeuse blows away sufficient mass (in the supernova stage);<br />and is left with a core mass below the Chandrasekhar limit;<br />the core can form a white dwarf</p>

<p>the (outer layers of the star) undergo a (periodic) expansion and contraction;<br />which produces a (periodic) variation in its luminosity/apparent brightness;<br />the (average) luminosity depends on the period of variation;<br />by measuring the period, the luminosity can be found;<br />by then measuring its apparent brightness, its distance from Earth can be found;</p>
