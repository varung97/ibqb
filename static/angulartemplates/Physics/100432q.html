<p>A wide range of frequencies of ultrasound may be used to image internal body organs. The choice of frequency for imaging a particular organ is determined by the depth of the organ beneath the skin.</p>
<p>Outline, with reference to attenuation and resolution, why the depth of the organ determines the choice of ultrasound frequency.</p>
