<p><em>Look for an argument along these lines:</em><br />the speed of light is independent of speed of source;<br />because of the direction of acceleration;<br />to Kim it will appear as if <em>L</em><sub>1</sub> is moving away from her;<br />light from&nbsp;<em>L</em><sub>1</sub> will therefore be Doppler shifted toward the red end of the spectrum;</p>
<p><em><strong>or</strong></em></p>
<p>accelerating spaceship is equivalent to being at rest in a gravitational field / <em>OWTTE</em>;<br />photons leaving the source therefore gain potential energy and lose kinetic energy;<br />since <em>E</em>=<em>hf</em>;<br />Kim will measure a lower frequency;</p>

<p>according to the equivalence principle the accelerating spaceship is equivalent to a frame of reference at rest in a (uniform) gravitational field / can be regarded as being at rest on the surface of a planet/large mass / <em>OWTTE</em>;<br />if light is red shifted from <em>L</em><sub>1</sub> then this implies period of the light source is longer therefore time is slower / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
