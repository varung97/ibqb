<p>Nuclei of the isotope nitrogen-14 are bombarded with neutrons and as a result nuclei of an isotope of carbon are produced. The nuclear reaction equation for this process may be written as</p>
<p>\[_7^{14}{\rm{N}} + {\rm{neutron}} \to {}_6^A{\rm{C}} + {\rm{proton}}\]</p>
<p>What is the nucleon number <em>A</em> of the isotope of carbon?</p>
<p>A. 12</p>
