<div class='question'>
<p>Two containers, X and Y, are each filled by an ideal gas at the same temperature. The volume of Y is half the volume of X. The number of moles of gas in Y is three times the number of moles of the gas in X. The pressure of the gas in X is <em>P</em><sub>X</sub> and the pressure of the gas in Y is <em>P</em><sub>Y</sub>.</p>
<p>What is the ratio \(\frac{{{P_X}}}{{{P_Y}}}\)?</p>
<p>A. \(\frac{1}{6}\)</p>
<p>B. \(\frac{2}{3}\)</p>
<p>C. \(\frac{3}{2}\)</p>
