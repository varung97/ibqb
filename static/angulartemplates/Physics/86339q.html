<p>An observer at rest relative to Earth observes two spaceships. Each spaceship is moving with a speed of 0.85<em>c</em> but in opposite directions. The observer measures the rate of increase of distance between the spaceships to be 1.7<em>c</em>.</p>
<p>(i) Outline whether this observation contravenes the theory of special relativity.</p>
<p>(ii) Determine, according to an observer in one of the spaceships, the speed of the other spaceship.</p>

<p>The observer on Earth in (a) watches one spaceship as it travels to a distant star at a speed of 0.85<em>c</em>. According to observers on the spaceship, this journey takes 8.0 years.</p>
<p>(i) Calculate, according to the observer on Earth, the time taken for the journey to the star.</p>
<p>(ii) Outline whether the time interval measured by the observer on Earth is a proper time interval.</p>
<p>(iii) Calculate, according to the observer on Earth, the distance from Earth to the star.</p>
<p>(iv) The observers in the spaceship send a message to Earth halfway through their journey. Determine how long it takes the message to arrive at Earth according to the observers on the spaceship.</p>
