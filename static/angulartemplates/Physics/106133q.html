<p class="p1">This question is about a Galilean transformation and time dilation.</p>
<p class="p1">Ben is in a spaceship that is travelling in a straight-line with constant speed <em>v </em>as measured by Jill who is in a space station.</p>

<p class="p1">Ben switches on a light pulse that bounces vertically (as observed by Ben) between two horizontal mirrors \({{\text{M}}_{\text{1}}}\) and \({{\text{M}}_{\text{2}}}\) separated by a distance \(d\). At the instant that the mirrors are opposite Jill, the pulse is just leaving the mirror \({{\text{M}}_{\text{2}}}\). The speed of light in air is \(c\).</p>

<p class="p1">The questions (e) and (f ) introduce the concepts of time dilation and length contraction. Discuss how muon decay in the atmosphere provides experimental evidence for these concepts.</p>
