<div class='question'>
<p>speed of light is independent of speed of source;<br />so (because of acceleration) source appears to move away from Louise / <em>OWTTE</em>;<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Doppler</span> effect predicts a red-shift;<br />Louise measures a lower frequency;</p>
<p><em><strong>or</strong></em></p>
<p>accelerating spaceship is equivalent to being at rest in a gravitational field / <em>OWTTE</em>;<br />photons leaving the source therefore gain potential energy and lose kinetic energy;<br />since <em>E</em>=<em>hf</em>;<br />Louise will measure a lower frequency;</p>
