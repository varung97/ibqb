<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='question'>
<p>This question is about neutrinos.</p>
<p>The spectrum of electron energies emitted in a typical &beta;-decay is continuous. Describe how this observation led physicists to propose the existence of the particles now called neutrinos.</p>

<p><em>Look for these points:</em><br />idea that total energy released in the decay is fixed;<br />beta particle energies are less than this value/continuous;<br />the neutrino is postulated to account for this &ldquo;missing&rdquo; energy;</p>
