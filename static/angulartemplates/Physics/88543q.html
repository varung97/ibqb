<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='question'>
<p>A parallel beam of coherent light of wavelength <em>&lambda;</em> is incident on a rectangular slit of width <em>d</em>. After passing through the slit the light is incident on a screen a distance <em>D</em> from the slit where<em> D</em> is much greater than <em>d</em>. What is the width of the central maximum of the diffraction pattern as measured on the screen?</p>
<p>A. \(\frac{{2D\lambda }}{d}\)</p>
<p>B. \(\frac{{2d}}{{D\lambda }}\)</p>
<p>C. \(\frac{{D\lambda }}{d}\)</p>
<p>D. \(\frac{d}{{D\lambda }}\)</p>
