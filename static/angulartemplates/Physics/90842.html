<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">This question is about simultaneity.</p>
<p class="p1">Daniela is standing in the middle of a train that is moving at a constant velocity relative to Jaime, who is standing on the platform. At the moment the train passes Jaime, two beams of light, X and Y, are emitted simultaneously from a device held by Daniela. Both beams are reflected by mirrors at the end of the train and then return to Daniela.</p>

<p class="p1">beam X will reach the mirror first;</p>
<p class="p1">the speed of light of each beam is constant for all inertial observers;</p>
<p class="p1">the left mirror moves towards the beam X while the right mirror moves away from the beam Y;</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p class="p1">the beams returning to Daniela occur at one point in space;</p>
<p class="p1">if this is simultaneous to Daniela, the event will also be simultaneous to Jaime;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><em>or</em></strong></p>
<p class="p1">beam X has less to go to the mirror and then longer to Daniela, whilst beam Y has longer to the mirror and less to Daniela;</p>
<p class="p1">the sum of the times are the same because Daniela is in the middle so they arrive at the same time;</p>
