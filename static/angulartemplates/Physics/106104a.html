<p class="p1">the amount of red-shift enables the recession speed of a galaxy to be determined;</p>
<p class="p1">Hubble&rsquo;s law states that the recession speed is proportional to its distance from Earth/ \(v = {H_0}d\) with terms defined;</p>
<p class="p1">if the constant of proportionality/ \({H_0}\) is known then <em>d </em>can be determined;</p>
