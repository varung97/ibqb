<p class="p1">A rubber ball, travelling in a horizontal direction, strikes a vertical wall. It rebounds at right angles to the wall. The graph below illustrates the variation of the ball&rsquo;s momentum \(p\)<em>&nbsp;</em>with time \(t\)<em>&nbsp;</em>when the ball is in contact with the wall.</p>
