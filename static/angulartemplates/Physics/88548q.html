<div class='question'>
<p>An electron X is accelerated from rest through a potential difference <em>V</em>. Another electron Y is accelerated from rest through a potential difference 2<em>V</em>. After acceleration, the de Broglie wavelength of X is <em>&lambda;</em><sub>X</sub> and that of Y is <em>&lambda;</em><sub>Y</sub>. The speeds reached by the electrons are well below that of the speed of light.</p>
<p>What is the ratio \(\frac{{{\lambda _{\rm{X}}}}}{{{\lambda _{\rm{Y}}}}}\)?</p>
<p>A. 2</p>
<p>B. \(\sqrt 2 \)</p>
<p>C. \(\frac{1}{2}\)</p>
<p>D. \(\frac{1}{{\sqrt 2 }}\)</p>
