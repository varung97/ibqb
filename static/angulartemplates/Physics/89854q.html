<p class="p1">Three resistors of resistance \(R\) are connected in parallel across a cell of electromotive force (emf) \(V\) that has a negligible internal resistance. What is the rate at which the cell supplies energy?</p>
<p class="p1">A. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\(\frac{{{V^2}}}{{3R}}\)</p>
<p class="p1">B. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\(\frac{{{V^2}}}{{9R}}\)</p>
<p class="p1">C. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\(\frac{{9{V^2}}}{R}\)</p>
<p class="p1">D. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\(\frac{{3{V^2}}}{R}\)</p>
