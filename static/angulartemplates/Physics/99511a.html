<p>emission of (alpha/beta/gamma) particles/photons/electromagnetic radiation;<br />nucleus becomes more (energetically) stable;<br />constant probability of decay (per unit time);<br />is random process;<br />activity/number of unstable nuclei in sample reduces by half over constant time intervals/exponentially;<br />not affected by temperature/environment / is spontaneous process;</p>

<p>(i) 93;</p>
<p>(ii) mass of products is less than mass of reactants / there is a mass defect;<br />mass is converted into energy (according to equation <em>E</em>=<em>mc</em><sup>2</sup>);</p>
<p>(iii) the (minimum) energy required to (completely) separate the nucleons in a nucleus / the energy released when a nucleus is assembled from its constituent nucleons;</p>
<p>(iv) calculation of binding energies as shown below;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">americium-241 = 241&times;7.54=1817.14 MeV<br />neptunium-237 = 237&times;7.58 = 1796.46 MeV<br />helium-4 = 4&times;7.07 = 28.28 MeV</p>
<p>energy released is the difference of binding energies;<br />and so equals 7.60 MeV;</p>
