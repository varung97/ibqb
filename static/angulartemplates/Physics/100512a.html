<p>(i) ground observer measures a zero proper time interval for the two arrivals;<br />all other observers measure a time interval of <em>&gamma;</em>&times;0=0;<br />hence the arrivals are simultaneous for all observers, including rocket&nbsp;<br /><em>Award <strong>[1]</strong> for statement that &ldquo;events that are simultaneous for one observer</em><br /><em>and occur at the same place are simultaneous for all observers&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p>(ii) according to the rocket observer, the ground observer moves towards the&nbsp;signal from tree L and away from the signal from tree R;<br />since the signals move at the same speed and they arrive at the same time&nbsp;according to the rocket observer;<br />signal from tree R must have been emitted first</p>
