<div class='question'>
<p>Alpha particles with energy E are directed at nuclei with atomic number Z. Small deviations from the predictions of the Rutherford scattering model are observed.</p>
<p>Which change in E and which change in Z is most likely to result in greater deviations from the Rutherford scattering model?</p>
