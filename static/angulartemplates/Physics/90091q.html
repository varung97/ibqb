<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">This question is about sound waves.</p>
<p class="p1">A whistle on a steam train consists of a pipe that is open at one end and closed at the other. The sounding length of the whistle is 0.27 m and the steam pressure in the whistle is so great that the third harmonic of the pipe is sounding. The speed of sound in air is \({\text{340 m}}\,{{\text{s}}^{ - 1}}\).</p>
