<p>(i) the &alpha; particles produced have discrete energies;<br />the gamma rays produced have discrete energies;<br />since the energies of the &alpha; particles and of the photons are determined by the&nbsp;difference in nuclear energy levels this implies that nuclear energy levels are&nbsp;also discrete;</p>
<p>(ii) the &beta;<sup>+</sup> spectrum is continuous;<br />the neutrino was postulated to account for those &beta;<sup>+</sup> with less energy than the&nbsp;maximum;</p>
