<p>(i) X-rays travelling in a medium experience attenuation. State what is meant by attenuation.</p>
<p>(ii) Show that the half-value thickness \({x_{\frac{1}{2}}}\) is related to the attenuation coefficient&nbsp;\(\mu \) by</p>
<p>\[\mu {x_{\frac{1}{2}}} = 1{\rm{n}}2\]</p>
<p>(iii) Estimate the fraction of the incident intensity of an X-ray beam that has travelled through 2.0 cm of muscle. The half-value thickness of muscle is 0.73 cm.</p>
