<p>A 300 W immersion heater is placed in a beaker containing 0.25 kg of water at&nbsp;a temperature of 18&deg;C. The heater is switched on for 120 s, after which time the&nbsp;temperature of the water is 45&deg;C. The thermal capacity of the beaker is negligible and&nbsp;the specific heat capacity of water is 4.2&times;10<sup>3</sup>J kg<sup>&ndash;1</sup>K<sup>&ndash;1</sup>.</p>
<p>(i) Estimate the change in internal energy of the water.</p>
<p>(ii) Determine the rate at which thermal energy is transferred from the water to the&nbsp;surroundings during the time that the heater is switched on.</p>

<p>The water in (b) is further heated until it starts to boil at constant temperature. It is boiled&nbsp;for 500s measured from the time that it first starts to boil. The mass of water remaining&nbsp;after this time is 0.20kg.</p>
<p>(i) Estimate, using the answer to (b)(ii), the specific latent heat of vaporization of&nbsp;the water.</p>
<p>(ii) Explain, in terms of the energy of the molecules of the water, why the water boils&nbsp;at constant temperature.</p>
