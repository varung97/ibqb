<p>an electric field applied along the axis of a piezoelectric crystal causes the crystal to expand or contract;<br />a high frequency alternating <em>E</em> field will cause the crystal to oscillate at the frequency of the applied field;<br />the oscillations are transferred to the surrounding air producing ultrasound;</p>

<p>no contrast between heart and surroundings as X-rays will not be absorbed by the heart;<br />ultrasound will be reflected/transmitted by different amounts by the slightly differing densities and depths of the heart tissue; <br /><em>Do not accept answers based on &ldquo;X-rays are harmful&rdquo;.</em></p>

<p>acoustic impedance of skin is very much greater than that of air so nearly all incident ultrasound is reflected at air/skin boundary;<br />gel has same acoustic impedance as skin so nearly all ultrasound will be transmitted through the skin;</p>

<p>high frequency ultrasound gives better resolution;<br />but is subject to more attenuation;<br />the further the distance the ultrasound travels the more it is attenuated;<br />the deeper an organ therefore the lower the frequency used in order to minimize attenuation / a compromise has to be made between resolution and attenuation;</p>
