<p>(i) mass lost in 300 s=(1.880-1.580)=0.3 (kg);<br />(energy supplied=750 kJ) (do not award credit for this line)<br /><em>L</em>=2.5 MJ kg<sup>&ndash;1</sup>; <em>(unit must appear correctly here)<br />Award <strong>[2]</strong> for a bald correct answer.</em></p>
<p>(ii) energy will be transferred to surroundings; } <em>(accept energy is lost by/from kettle to surroundings)</em><br />so calculated energy to water is too large / change in mass too large;<br />(hence overestimate)<br /><em>Award <strong>[0]</strong> for a bald correct answer.</em><br /><em>Treat references to energy gained by kettle as neutral; the kettle is at a </em><em>constant temperature.</em></p>
