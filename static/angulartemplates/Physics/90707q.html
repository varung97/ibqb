<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">This question is about muon decay.</p>
<p class="p1">Muons are produced in the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere at a height of around 10 km above the surface. They then travel at a speed of around 0.98c towards the Earth. The average time for a muon to decay is approximately \({\text{2.2 }}\mu {\text{s}}\), according to observers at rest relative to the muon.</p>

<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">Many muons are observed to reach the surface of the Earth.</p>

<p class="p1">Deduce that few muons would be expected to arrive at the surface of the Earth if non-relativistic mechanics are assumed.</p>
