<div class='question'>
<p>The input power to a single optic fibre X is 25 mW. The signal needs to be amplified&nbsp;when the power has been attenuated to 4.0 &times;10<sup>&ndash;19</sup> W. The attenuation loss in the&nbsp;optic fibre is 1.8 dB km<sup>&ndash;1</sup>.</p>
<p>Calculate the maximum distance between amplifiers in the system.</p>
