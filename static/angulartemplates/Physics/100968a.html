<p>strong field causes protons (in the body) to precess/align with the field;<br />gradient magnetic field applied so that magnetic field at every point in the body is&nbsp;different;<br />radio frequency radiation directed at the body excites protons (to a higher energy state);<br />frequency emitted (by de-exciting protons) depends on magnetic field;<br />frequency determines point of emission (since different parts of the body correspond to&nbsp;different frequency);<br />intensity of radiation/relaxation times depend on type of tissue (so that contrast can&nbsp;be achieved);</p>
