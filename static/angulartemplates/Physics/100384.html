<p>This question is about the development of the universe.</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;'>
<p>Light from distant galaxies, as seen by an observer on Earth, shows a red-shift. Outline why this observation suggests that the universe is expanding.</p>

<p>The future development of the universe is determined by the relationship between the apparent density of the universe and the critical density.</p>
<p>(i) Define the term <em>critical density</em>.</p>
<p>(ii) Discuss how the density of the universe determines its future development. Your discussion should include <strong>one</strong> problem associated with determining the density of the universe.</p>

<p>because of the Doppler effect;<br />light from sources moving away from an observer is observed to have a lower frequency than from the sources when stationary / redshift indicates motion away from observer/Earth;</p>

<p>(i) this is the value of density for which the universe will begin to contract after an infinite amount of time;<br /><em>Do not accept &ldquo;density at which universe is flat&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p>(ii) if the density of the universe is less than the critical density it will continue expanding forever;<br />if the density is greater than the critical density then it will after a certain amount of time begin to contract;<br />the behaviour of galaxies suggests that there is more matter in the universe than is actually observed; { <em>(allow other relevant</em> <em>comment about</em> <em>dark matter)</em><br />without knowing the mass of this matter the density cannot be determined;</p>
