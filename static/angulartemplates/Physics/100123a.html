<p>effect caused by gas such as H<sub>2</sub>O/NH<sub>3</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub>/greenhouse gas in the atmosphere;<br />gas absorbs outgoing (long wave) radiation from Earth;<br />gas re-radiates some of the energy back to Earth;</p>

<p>(i) \(\frac{{3.0 \times {{10}^8}}}{{6.5 \times {{10}^{13}}}} = 4.6\left( {\mu m} \right)\);<br />&asymp;5(&mu;m)</p>
<p>(ii) water vapour molecules have a natural frequency of oscillation;<br />if this frequency of oscillation is&nbsp;\(6.5 \times {10^{13}}\) / reference to frequency at X;<br />due to resonance this radiation is readily absorbed by the molecules / the radiation matches the natural frequency of oscillation;</p>
<p><em><strong>or</strong></em></p>
<p>X is a natural frequency (of oscillation) of water molecule;<br />so resonance effects mean that molecules are excited at this frequency;<br />and energy is removed/less energy transmitted from electromagnetic waves at this (particular) frequency;</p>
<p>(iii) energy gained by absorption needs to be re-emitted (as molecules de-excite);<br />in other directions / some returns to Earth;</p>
<p>(iv) more greenhouse gases means that there is more absorption of outgoing radiation;<br />therefore more energy returns to Earth;<br />leading to a further/greater increase in the temperature of the surface (of Earth);</p>
