<div class='question'>
<p>A Cepheid star and non-Cepheid star both belong to the same distant galaxy. Explain, stating the quantities that need to be measured, how the luminosity of the non-Cepheid star may be determined.</p>

<div class='question'>
<p>measure period and average apparent brightness/magnitude of the Cepheid to determine its distance;<br />measuring the apparent brightness of the star gives the luminosity (since distance is now known) from <em>L</em>=4&pi;<em>d</em><sup>2</sup><em>b</em>;</p>
<p><em><strong>or</strong></em></p>
<p>measure period of Cepheid to determine its (average) luminosity;<br />compare the apparent brightness of the star and Cepheid to find <em>L</em> using <em>L</em>&prop;<em>b</em>;</p>
