<p>T measures a zero proper time interval for the arrivals of the light;<br />so G measures a time interval equal to \(\gamma \)&times;0=0 also;</p>
<p>(ii) according to G, T is moving away from the light from the left strike and yet receives the light at the same time as the light from the right strike;<br />since <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the speed of light is the same</span> for light from both strikes;<br />the left strike occurred first<br /><em>No marks for just stating left strike is first.
