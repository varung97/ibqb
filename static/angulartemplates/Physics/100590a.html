<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>in deep inelastic scattering experiments the energy transferred to the constituents of hadrons is very large;<br />the scattering pattern is consistent with quarks inside hadrons behaving as free particles / the interaction between the constituents is very weak (asymptotic freedom);</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>there are electrically neutral constituents inside hadrons / there are gluons within hadrons;<br />quarks come in (three) colours;<br />quarks are charged particles;</p>
