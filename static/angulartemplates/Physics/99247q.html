<div class='question'>
<p>In a particular experiment, moving kaon mesons collide with stationary protons. The following reaction takes place<br />\[p + {K^ - } \to {K^0} + {K^ + } + X\]</p>
<p>where X is an unknown particle. This process involves the strong interaction. The quark&nbsp;structure of the kaons is \({K^ - } = \bar us\), \({K^0} = d\bar s\), and \({K^ + } = \bar us\).</p>
<p>(i) State the strangeness of the unknown particle X.</p>
<p>(ii) Particle X is a hadron. State and explain whether X is a meson <strong>or</strong> a baryon.</p>
