<p>A train is passing through a tunnel of proper length 80 m. The proper length of the train&nbsp;is 100 m. According to an observer at rest relative to the tunnel, when the front of the train&nbsp;coincides with one end of the tunnel, the rear of the train coincides with the other end of&nbsp;the tunnel.</p>

<p>For an observer on the train, it is the tunnel that is moving and therefore will appear&nbsp;length contracted. This seems to contradict the observation made by the observer at&nbsp;rest to the tunnel, creating a paradox. Explain how this paradox is resolved. You may refer to your spacetime diagram in (b).</p>
