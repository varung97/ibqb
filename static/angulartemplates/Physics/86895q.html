<div class='question'>
<p>This question is about internal energy.</p>
<p>(i) Mathilde raises the temperature of water in an electric kettle to boiling point. Once the water is boiling steadily, she measures the change in the mass of the kettle and its contents over a period of time.</p>
<p>The following data are available.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Initial mass of kettle and water = 1.880 kg<br />Final mass of kettle and water = 1.580 kg<br />Time between mass measurements = 300 s<br />Power dissipation in the kettle = 2.5 kW</p>
<p>Determine the specific latent heat of vaporization of water.</p>
<p>(ii) Outline why your answer to (b)(i) is an overestimate of the specific latent heat of vaporization of water.</p>
