<p><strong>Part 2</strong> Melting of the Pobeda ice island</p>
</div>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;'>
<p>The Pobeda ice island forms regularly when icebergs run aground near the Antarctic ice shelf. The &ldquo;island&rdquo;, which consists of a slab of pure ice, breaks apart and melts over a period of decades. The following data are available.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Typical dimensions of surface of island = 70 km &times; 35 km<br />Typical height of island = 240 m<br />Average temperature of the island = &ndash;35&deg;C<br />Density of sea ice = 920 kg m<sup>&ndash;3</sup><br />Specific latent heat of fusion of ice = 3.3&times;10<sup>5</sup>J kg<sup>&ndash;1</sup><br />Specific heat capacity of ice = 2.1&times;10\(^3\)J kg<sup>&ndash;1</sup>K<sup>&ndash;1</sup></p>
<p>(i) Distinguish, with reference to molecular motion and energy, between solid ice and liquid water.</p>
<p>(ii) Show that the energy required to melt the island to form water at 0&deg;C is about 2&times;10<sup>20</sup>J. Assume that the top and bottom surfaces of the island are flat and that it has vertical sides.</p>
<p>(iii) The Sun supplies thermal energy at an average rate of 450 W m<sup>&ndash;2</sup> to the surface of the island. The albedo of melting ice is 0.80. Determine an estimate of the time taken to melt the island assuming that the melted water is removed immediately and that no heat is lost to the surroundings.</p>
