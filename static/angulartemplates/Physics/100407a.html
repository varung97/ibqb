<p>(i) <em>Look for an argument along these lines:</em><br />on the return of the travelling twin according to the twin on Earth the travelling twin will have aged very little compared to himself/herself;<br />however, since time dilation is symmetric it could be the twin on Earth who has done the least aging;<br />experiment suggests that it is the travelling twin who ages the least;</p>
<p>(ii) because of the accelerations undergone by the travelling twin the situation is not symmetric / travelling twin is not in the same inertial frame of reference/changes inertial frame of reference;</p>

<p>using the laboratory half-life, most of the muons would have decayed before reaching Earth;<br />however many muons are detected at the surface;<br />showing that the half-life is dilated / to the muons the distance travelled is contracted;</p>
