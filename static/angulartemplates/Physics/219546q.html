<div class='question'>
<p>Unpolarized light of intensity <em>I<sub>0</sub></em> is incident on a polarizing filter. Light from this filter is incident on&nbsp;a second filter, which has its axis of polarization at 30˚ to that of the first filter.</p>
<p>The value of cos 30˚ is \(\frac{{\sqrt 3 }}{2}\). What is the intensity of the light emerging through the second filter?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp;\(\frac{{\sqrt 3 }}{2}\)<em>I<sub>0</sub></em></p>
<p>B.&nbsp;\(\frac{3}{2}\)<em>I<sub>0</sub></em></p>
<p>C.&nbsp;\(\frac{3}{4}\)<em>I<sub>0</sub></em></p>
<p>D.&nbsp;\(\frac{3}{8}\)<em>I<sub>0</sub></em></p>
