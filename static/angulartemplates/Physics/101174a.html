<p>(i) mention of superposition/interference;<br />interference is destructive and so there will be no light at P;&nbsp;<br /><em>Award <strong>[0]</strong> for correct answer with no or wrong argument.</em></p>
<p>(ii) there will be light at P;<br />the two sources cannot interfere because their planes of polarization are at right&nbsp;angles;&nbsp;<br /><em>Award<strong> [0]</strong> for correct answer with no or wrong argument.
