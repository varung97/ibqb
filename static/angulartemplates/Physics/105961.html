<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">Some nuclear reactors have a heat exchanger that uses a gas that is kept at constant volume. The first law of thermodynamics can be represented as \(Q = \Delta U + W\).</p>
</div>

<div class='question'>
<p class="p1">(i) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>State the meanings of \(Q\) and \(W\).</p>
<p class="p1">\(Q\):</p>
<p class="p1">\(W\):</p>
<p class="p1">(ii) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>Describe how the first law of thermodynamics applies in the operation of the heat exchanger.</p>
<p class="p1">(iii) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>Discuss the entropy changes that take place in the gas and in the surroundings.</p>

<div class='question'>
<p class="p1">(i) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>\(Q\): is the energy transferred between the system and surroundings;</p>
<p class="p1">\(W\): work done on/by system;</p>
<p class="p1">(ii) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\(Q\) transferred from reactor to gas;</p>
<p class="p1">no change in volume therefore \(W = 0\);</p>
<p class="p1">internal energy of gas increases;</p>
<p class="p1">\(Q\) transferred from gas to surroundings therefore internal energy of gas</p>
<p class="p1">decreases;</p>
<p class="p1">(iii) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>entropy of the gas initially increases as energy transferred from the reactor;</p>
<p class="p1">entropy of the surroundings increases as energy transferred (from the gas);</p>
<p class="p1">entropy of gas decreases on cooling;</p>
<p class="p1">overall the entropy of the total system increases;</p>
