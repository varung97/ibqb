<p><strong>Part 2</strong> Wind power and the greenhouse effect</p>
</div>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;'>
<p>A coal-fired power station has a power output of 4.0GW. It has been suggested that a&nbsp;wind farm could replace this power station. Using the data below, determine the area&nbsp;that the wind farm would occupy in order to meet the same power output as the coal-fired<br />power station.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Radius of wind turbine blades = 42 m<br />Area required by each turbine = 5.0&times;10<sup>4 </sup>m<sup>2<br /></sup>Efficiency of a turbine = 30%<br />Average annual wind speed = 12 m s<sup>&ndash;1<br /></sup>Average annual density of air = 1.2 kg m<sup>&ndash;3</sup></p>

<p>Wind power does not involve the production of greenhouse gases. Outline why&nbsp;the surface temperature of the Earth is higher than would be expected without the&nbsp;greenhouse effect.</p>

<p>The average solar intensity incident at the surface of the Earth is 238 W m<sup>&ndash;2</sup>.</p>
<p>(i) Assuming that the emissivity of the surface of the Earth is 1.0, estimate the&nbsp;average surface temperature if there were no greenhouse effect.</p>
<p>(ii) The enhanced greenhouse effect suggests that in several decades the predicted&nbsp;temperature of the atmosphere will be 250 K. The emissivity of the atmosphere&nbsp;is 0.78. Show that this atmospheric temperature increase will lead to a predicted&nbsp;average Earth surface temperature of 292 K.</p>
