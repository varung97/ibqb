<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='question'>
<p>Muons are unstable particles with a proper lifetime of 2.2 &mu;s. Muons are produced 2.0 km&nbsp;above ground and move downwards at a speed of 0.98<em>c</em> relative to the ground. For this&nbsp;speed \(\gamma \) = 5.0. Discuss, with suitable calculations, how this experiment provides evidence&nbsp;for time dilation.</p>
