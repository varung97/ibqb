<p class="p1">Nuclear reactors are used to generate energy. In a particular nuclear reactor, neutrons collide elastically with carbon-12 nuclei \(\left( {_{\;{\text{6}}}^{{\text{12}}}{\text{C}}} \right)\) that act as the moderator of the reactor. A neutron with an initial speed of \(9.8 \times {10^6}{\text{ m}}\,{{\text{s}}^{ - 1}}\) collides head-on with a stationary carbon-12 nucleus. Immediately after the collision the carbon-12 nucleus has a speed of \(1.5 \times {10^6}{\text{ m}}\,{{\text{s}}^{ - 1}}\).</p>
