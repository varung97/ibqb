<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">Electrical energy is obtained from tidal energy at La Rance in France.</p>
<p class="p1">Water flows into a river basin from the sea for six hours and then flows from the basin back to the sea for another six hours. The water flows through turbines and generates energy during both flows.</p>
<p class="p1">The following data are available.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>Area of river basin <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>\( = 22{\text{ k}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{2}}}\)</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>Change in water level of basin over six hours <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>\( = 6.0{\text{ m}}\)</p>

<p class="p1">Nuclear reactors are used to generate energy. In a particular nuclear reactor, neutrons collide elastically with carbon-12 nuclei \(\left( {_{\;{\text{6}}}^{{\text{12}}}{\text{C}}} \right)\) that act as the moderator of the reactor. A neutron with an initial speed of \(9.8 \times {10^6}{\text{ m}}\,{{\text{s}}^{ - 1}}\) collides head-on with a stationary carbon-12 nucleus. Immediately after the collision the carbon-12 nucleus has a speed of \(1.5 \times {10^6}{\text{ m}}\,{{\text{s}}^{ - 1}}\).</p>

<p class="p1">(i)<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>The basin empties over a six hour period. Show that about \(6000{\text{ }}{{\text{m}}^3}\) of water flows through the turbines every second.</p>
<p class="p1">(ii) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>Show that the average power that the water can supply over the six hour period is about 0.2 GW.</p>
<p class="p2">(iii) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>La Rance tidal power station has an energy output of \(5.4 \times {10^8}{\text{ kW}}\,{\text{h}}\) per year. Calculate the overall efficiency of the power station. Assume that the water can supply 0.2 GW at all times.</p>
<p class="p2">Energy resources such as La Rance tidal power station could replace the use of</p>
<p class="p2">fossil fuels. This may result in an increase in the average albedo of Earth.</p>
