<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;'>
<p>Aldebaran is a red giant star in the constellation of Taurus.</p>
<p>(i) Describe the differences between a constellation and a stellar cluster.</p>
<p>(ii) Define the <em>luminosity</em> of a star.</p>
<p>(iii) The apparent brightness of Aldebaran is 3.3 &times;10<sup>&ndash;8</sup> W m<sup>&ndash;2</sup> and the luminosity of the&nbsp;Sun is 3.9 &times;10<sup>26</sup> W. The luminosity of Aldebaran is 370 times that of the Sun. Show&nbsp;that Aldebaran is at a distance of 19 pc from Earth. (1 pc=3.1 &times; 10<sup>16</sup> m)</p>

<p>(i) a constellation is a collection of stars that form a (recognizable) pattern&nbsp;(as viewed from Earth);<br />the distances between the stars may be very large;<br />a stellar cluster is a group of stars held together by (mutual) gravitational&nbsp;attraction/gravity/are physically relatively close;<br />there can be many thousands of stars in the cluster;<br />all stars in the cluster were created about the same time;</p>
<p>(ii) the (total) power radiated/emitted/produced (by the star);</p>
<p>(iii) luminosity of Aldebaran = 370&times;3.9&times;10<sup>26</sup>=1.44&times;10<sup>29</sup> W;<br />\( = \sqrt {\frac{{1.44 \times {{10}^{29}}}}{{4\pi&nbsp; \times 3.3 \times {{10}^{ - 8}}}}}&nbsp; = 5.9 \times {10^{17}}\);<br />\( = \frac{{5.9 \times {{10}^{17}}}}{{3.1 \times {{10}^{16}}}} = 19{\rm{pc}}\);</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>the (outer layers of the star) undergo a (periodic) expansion and contraction;<br />which produces a (periodic) variation in its luminosity/apparent brightness;<br />the (average) luminosity depends on the period of variation;<br />by measuring the period, the luminosity can be found;<br />by then measuring its apparent brightness, its distance from Earth can be found;</p>
