<p class="p1"><em>Look for these main points however expressed.</em></p>
<p class="p1">muons produced in the upper atmosphere have speeds close to \(c\);</p>
<p class="p1">many such muons are observed reaching the surface of Earth;</p>
<p class="p1">the half-life as measured in a muon&rsquo;s frame of reference does not give time for many to reach Earth / means many will have decayed in travelling to Earth;</p>
<p class="p1">but the contracted length of the journey/length as measured in a muon&rsquo;s reference frame means there is sufficient time;</p>
<p class="p1">and the dilated time/time measured by Earth observer is also sufficient for muons to reach the surface;</p>
