<p class="p1">The gas is compressed rapidly by moving the piston in the direction shown. The best explanation for the resulting increase in temperature of the gas is that the molecules of the gas gain kinetic energy</p>
<p class="p1">A.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;from the moving piston.</p>
<p class="p1">B.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;by colliding more frequently with each other.</p>
<p class="p1">C.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;by being pushed closer together.</p>
<p class="p1">D.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;by colliding more frequently with the walls of the cylinder.</p>
