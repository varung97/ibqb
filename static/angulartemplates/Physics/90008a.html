<p>speed of light is the same for both observers O and S / events simultaneous in stationary reference frame are not (necessarily) simultaneous in moving reference frame;<br />S is moving so PS will be longer than QS when light reaches S;<br />so if light arrives simultaneously then light from P will have been in transit for longer than Q;<br />therefore P emits a flash before Q;</p>
