<p class="p1">This question is about the thermodynamics of a car engine and the dynamics of the car.</p>
<p class="p1">A car engine consists of four cylinders. In each of the cylinders, a fuel-air mixture explodes to supply power at the appropriate moment in the cycle.</p>
<p class="p1">The diagram models the variation of pressure <em>P </em>with volume <em>V </em>for one cycle of the gas, ABCDA, in one of the cylinders of the engine. The gas in the cylinder has a fixed mass and can be assumed to be ideal.</p>

<p>The car is travelling at its maximum speed of \({\text{56 m}}\,{{\text{s}}^{ - 1}}\). At this speed, the energy provided by the fuel injected into one cylinder in each cycle is 9200 J. One litre of fuel provides 56 MJ of energy.</p>
