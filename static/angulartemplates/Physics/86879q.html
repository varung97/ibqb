<p>This question is about energy sources.</p>
<p>A small island is situated in the Arctic. The islanders require an electricity supply but have no fossil fuels on the island. It is suggested that wind generators should be used in combination with power stations using either oil or nuclear fuel.</p>

<p>Conventional horizontal-axis wind generators have blades of length 4.7 m. The average wind speed on the island is 7.0 ms<sup>&minus;1</sup> and the average air density is 1.29 kg m<sup>&minus;3</sup>.</p>
<p>(i) Deduce the total energy, in GJ, generated by the wind generators in one year.</p>
<p>(ii) Explain why less energy can actually be generated by the wind generators than the value you deduced in (b)(i).</p>
