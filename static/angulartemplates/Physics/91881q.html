<p class="p1">This question is about relativistic kinematics.</p>
<p class="p1">The diagram shows a spaceship as it moves past Earth on its way to a planet P. The planet is at rest relative to Earth.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><img src="static/tinymce_asset/2040/Schermafbeelding_2016-09-11_om_10.50.39.png" alt="M14/4/PHYSI/SP3/ENG/TZ2/10" /></p>
<p class="p1">The distance between the Earth and planet P is 12 ly as measured by observers on Earth. The spaceship moves with speed 0.60c relative to Earth.</p>
<p class="p1">Consider two events:</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Event 1: when the spaceship is above Earth</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Event 2: when the spaceship is above planet P</p>
<p class="p1">Judy is in the spaceship and Peter is at rest on Earth.</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">Judy considers herself to be at rest. According to Judy, the Earth and planet P are moving to the left.</p>
