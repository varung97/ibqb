<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p class="p1">addition polymerization: unsaturated/containing C=C monomers add together without elimination/ removal of any atoms (to form polymer) / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p class="p1">condensation polymerization: monomers have two reactive sites/are bifunctional and produce a larger molecule with elimination/removal of a smaller molecule / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>OR </strong></p>
<p class="p1">in addition polymerisation unsaturated / containing C=C monomers undergo addition <strong>and </strong>in condensation polymerisation the monomer molecules have two reactive sites/ functional groups/ are bifunctional;</p>
<p class="p1">in the addition polymerisation reaction there are no by-products while in the condensation polymerisation reaction a small molecule is eliminated/ produced as a by-product;</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p class="p1">chain length: greater chain length, greater intermolecular forces, higher strength / melting point;</p>
<p class="p1">way groups are arranged/orientated: trans-orientation allows close approach between chains giving it greater strength / cis-orientation produces bent chains, does not allow close approach for strong bonding / <em>OWTTE </em>/ Kevlar example explained;</p>
<p class="p1">cross-linking: stronger covalent bonds in cross-linking lead to stronger / higher melting point / more rigid polymers (than linear or branched polymer) / <em>OWTTE </em>/ amount of cross-linking determines how rigid structure becomes / vulcanized rubber example: sulfur atoms create strong covalent links between chains / in phenol-methanal (Bakelite), benzene ring is bonded to CHin three / several positions (to produce rigid plastic); <span class="s1">2 </span></p>
<p class="p1">branching: depending on branching, close packing possible or prevented / amylose has a straight chain structure while amylopectin has straight linkages as well as branches;</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Need explanation for mark &ndash; no marks for branching related to LDPE and HDPE or isotactic and atactic arrangements as question is about condensation, not addition polymerization.</em></p>
