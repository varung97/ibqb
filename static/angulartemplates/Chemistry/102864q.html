<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">The element antimony, Sb, is usually found in nature as its sulfide ore, stibnite, \({\text{S}}{{\text{b}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{S}}_{\text{3}}}\). This ore was used two thousand years ago by ancient Egyptian women as a cosmetic to darken their eyes and eyelashes.</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">One method of extracting antimony from its sulfide ore is to roast the stibnite in air. This forms antimony oxide and sulfur dioxide. The antimony oxide is then reduced by carbon to form the free element.</p>
