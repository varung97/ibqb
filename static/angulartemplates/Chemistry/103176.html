<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">Analytical techniques are very useful in determining molecular structures. A compound, <strong>X</strong>, has the empirical formula \({{\text{C}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{4}}}{\text{O}}\).</p>
</div>

<div class='question'>
<p class="p1">Peaks in a \(^{\text{1}}{\text{H}}\,{\text{NMR}}\) spectrum are measured relative to a reference standard. State the name of a substance used and identify <strong>one </strong>property that makes it particularly suitable for this application.</p>
</div>
<h2 style='margin-top: 1em'>Markscheme</h2>
<div class='question'>
<p class="p1">tetramethylsilane/TMS;</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Any of these for second mark: </em></p>
<p class="p1">strong single peak (as there are 12 protons in identical chemical environment);</p>
<p class="p1">absorbs upfield/away from most other protons/H&rsquo;s;</p>
<p class="p1">low boiling point/bp / volatile (so easily removed from sample);</p>
<p class="p1">not toxic / unreactive / does not interfere with sample;</p>
</div>
