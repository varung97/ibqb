<p>A group of students investigated the rate of the reaction between aqueous sodium thiosulfate and hydrochloric acid according to the equation below.</p>
<p>\[{\text{N}}{{\text{a}}_2}{{\text{S}}_2}{{\text{O}}_3}{\text{(aq)}} + {\text{2HCl(aq)}} \to {\text{2NaCl(aq)}} + {\text{S}}{{\text{O}}_2}{\text{(g)}} + {\text{S(s)}} + {{\text{H}}_2}{\text{O(l)}}\]</p>
<p>The two reagents were rapidly mixed together in a beaker and placed over a mark on a piece of paper. The time taken for the precipitate of sulfur to obscure the mark when viewed through the reaction mixture was recorded.</p>

<p>Initially they measured out \({\text{10.0 c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of \({\text{0.500 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) hydrochloric acid and then added \({\text{40.0 c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of \({\text{0.0200 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) aqueous sodium thiosulfate. The mark on the paper was obscured 47 seconds after the solutions were mixed.</p>

<div class='specification'>
<p>The teacher asked the students to measure the effect of halving the concentration of sodium thiosulfate on the rate of reaction.</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p>The teacher asked the students to devise another technique to measure the rate of this reaction.</p>

<p>Another group suggested collecting the sulfur dioxide and drawing a graph of the volume of gas against time.</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;'>
<p>The teacher made up \({\text{2.50 d}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of the sodium thiosulfate solution using sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate crystals, \({\text{N}}{{\text{a}}_2}{{\text{S}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{3}}} \bullet {\text{5}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O}}\). Calculate the required mass of these crystals.</p>
