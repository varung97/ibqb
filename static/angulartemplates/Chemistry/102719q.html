<div class='question'>
<p class="p1">The reaction below represents the Haber process for the industrial production of ammonia.</p>
<p class="p2">\[\begin{array}{*{20}{l}} {{{\text{N}}_2}{\text{(g)}} + 3{{\text{H}}_2}{\text{(g)}} \rightleftharpoons {\text{2N}}{{\text{H}}_3}({\text{g)}}}&amp;{\Delta {H^\Theta } = - 92{\text{ kJ}}} \end{array}\]</p>
<p class="p1">The optimum conditions of temperature and pressure are chosen as a compromise between those that favour a high yield of ammonia and those that favour a fast rate of production. Economic considerations are also important.</p>
<p class="p1">Which statement is correct?</p>
<p class="p1">A. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>A higher temperature would ensure higher yield and a faster rate.</p>
<p class="p1">B. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>A lower pressure would ensure a higher yield at a lower cost.</p>
<p class="p1">C. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>A lower temperature would ensure a higher yield and a faster rate.</p>
<p class="p1">D. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>A higher pressure would ensure a higher yield at a higher cost.</p>
