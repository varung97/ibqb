<p>Two students were provided with three different isomers of \({{\text{C}}_{\text{3}}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{6}}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{2}}}\).</p>

<p>They were asked to suggest how the isomers could be distinguished and positively identified from each other using spectroscopic techniques. Student A said that they could be positively identified just from their infrared spectra. Student B said that they could be positively identified just from the number of peaks and the areas under each peak in their \(^{\text{1}}{\text{H}}\,{\text{NMR}}\) spectra.</p>
<p>Evaluate these two claims and suggest how any possible limitations could be overcome using the same spectroscopic technique.</p>

<p>Student A / Infrared:</p>
