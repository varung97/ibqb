<p>Phosphine is usually prepared by heating white phosphorus, one of the allotropes of phosphorus, with concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide. The equation for the reaction is:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">P4 (s) + 3OH<sup>&minus;</sup> (aq) + 3H<sub>2</sub>O (l) &rarr; PH<sub>3</sub> (g) + 3H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> (aq)</p>
<p>(i) Identify one other element that has allotropes and list <strong>two</strong> of its allotropes.</p>
<p>Element:</p>
<p>Allotrope 1:</p>
<p>Allotrope 2:</p>
<p>(ii) The first reagent is written as P<sub>4</sub>, not 4P. Describe the difference between&nbsp;P<sub>4</sub> and 4P.</p>
<p>(iii) The ion H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> is amphiprotic. Outline what is meant by amphiprotic, giving the formulas of both species it is converted to when it behaves in this manner.</p>
<p>(iv) State the oxidation state of phosphorus in&nbsp;P<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>.</p>
<p>P<sub>4</sub>:</p>
<p>H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>:</p>
<p>(v) Oxidation is now defined in terms of change of oxidation number. Explore how earlier definitions of oxidation and reduction may have led to conflicting answers for the conversion of&nbsp;P<sub>4</sub> to&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> and the way in which the use of oxidation numbers has resolved this.</p>

<p>2.478 g of white phosphorus was used to make phosphine according to the equation:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">P<sub>4</sub>(s) +3OH<sup>&minus;</sup>(aq)+3H<sub>2</sub>O(l) &rarr; PH<sub>3</sub>(g)+3H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>(aq)</p>
<p>(i) Calculate the amount, in mol, of white phosphorus used.</p>
