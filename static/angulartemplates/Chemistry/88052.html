<p>Two students were provided with three different isomers of \({{\text{C}}_{\text{3}}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{6}}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{2}}}\).</p>

<p>They were asked to suggest how the isomers could be distinguished and positively identified from each other using spectroscopic techniques. Student A said that they could be positively identified just from their infrared spectra. Student B said that they could be positively identified just from the number of peaks and the areas under each peak in their \(^{\text{1}}{\text{H}}\,{\text{NMR}}\) spectra.</p>
<p>Evaluate these two claims and suggest how any possible limitations could be overcome using the same spectroscopic technique.</p>

<p><em>Student A / Infrared</em></p>
<p>propanoic acid can be distinguished from the other two by the (broad) absorption at \({\text{2500&ndash;3300 c}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 1}}\) /due to &ndash;OH absorption in carboxylic acids;</p>
<p>not easy to distinguish between methyl ethanoate and ethyl methanoate because all absorb at \({\text{1700&ndash;1750 c}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 1}}\) / C=O / \({\text{1050&ndash;1410 c}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 1}}\) / C&ndash;O / \({\text{2850&ndash;3100 c}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 1}}\) / C&ndash;H / because they have same functional groups;</p>
<p>can be distinguished from the pattern in the fingerprint region / by comparing with spectra of known samples;</p>
<p><em>Student B / </em><sup><em>1</em></sup><em>H NMR</em></p>
<p>methyl ethanoate can be distinguished from the other two as it will have two peaks of equal area (due to the two &ndash;CH<sub>3</sub> groups);</p>
<p>propanoic acid and ethyl methanoate cannot be distinguished as both have three peaks / peaks in the ratio of 1:2:3;</p>
<p>chemical shift is also required to distinguish them;</p>
<p><em>Absorption value or name of functional group required for M1 and M2.</em></p>
