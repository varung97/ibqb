<p class="p1">The same quantity of electricity is passed through separate dilute aqueous solutions of sulfuric acid and copper(II) sulfate using platinum electrodes under the same conditions. Which statement is correct?</p>
<p class="p1">A. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>The same volume of oxygen is obtained in both cases.</p>
<p class="p1">B. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>The same volume of hydrogen is obtained in both cases.</p>
<p class="p1">C. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>The amount of copper deposited at the negative electrode in the copper(II) sulfate solution is half the amount of hydrogen gas formed at the negative electrode in the sulfuric acid solution.</p>
<p class="p1">D. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>The pH of both solutions increases as the electrolysis proceeds.</p>
