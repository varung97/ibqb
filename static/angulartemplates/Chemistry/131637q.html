<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p>Sodium thiosulfate solution reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to form a precipitate of sulfur at room temperature.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (aq) + 2HCl (aq) &rarr; S (s) + SO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>(g) + 2NaCl (aq) + X</p>
</div>

<div class='question'>
<p>(i) Using the graph, explain the order of reaction with respect to sodium thiosulfate.</p>
<p>(ii) In a different experiment, this reaction was found to be first order with respect to hydrochloric acid. Deduce the overall rate expression for the reaction.</p>
