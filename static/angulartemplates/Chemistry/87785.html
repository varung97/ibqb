<p align="LEFT">DNA made up of two polynucleotides that join to form a spiral/double helix;</p>
<p align="LEFT">two strands of nucleic acid interaction through hydrogen bonding network between</p>
<p align="LEFT">bases / polynucleotides linked by hydrogen bonds between bases;</p>
<p align="LEFT">alternating phosphate and sugar groups form the backbones with bases on the sugar;</p>
<p align="LEFT">thymine/T bonds to adenine/A <strong>and </strong>cytosine/C bonds to guanine/G;</p>
