<p>(i) &nbsp; &nbsp; A sample of liquid bromine was left in a closed conical (Erlenmeyer) flask at 298 K and allowed to reach a state of equilibrium. State an observation that indicates that equilibrium was reached.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) &nbsp; &nbsp; The temperature of the closed flask was increased and the system was allowed to reach a new equilibrium. Compare the equilibrium formed at the new temperature with the equilibrium at the original temperature on the molecular level.</p>
