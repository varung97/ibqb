<p class="p1"><em>Any three for first three marks: </em></p>
<p class="p1">both increase rate of chemical reactions;</p>
<p class="p1">both reduce activation energy;</p>
<p class="p1">both provide alternative pathways for reaction;</p>
<p class="p1">enzymes more specific;</p>
<p class="p1">enzymes have active site that substrate bonds to / &ldquo;lock and key&rdquo; mechanism;</p>
<p class="p1">enzymes much more readily denatured by changing conditions;</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Both required for final two marks: </em></p>
<p class="p1">competitive inhibitors <strong>and </strong>non-competitive inhibitors;</p>
<p class="p1">competitive inhibitors bond to active site <strong>and </strong>non-competitive inhibitors denature/alter shape of enzyme;</p>
