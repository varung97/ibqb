<p class="p1">ring consists of one nitrogen atom and three carbon atoms (and three hydrogen atoms);</p>
<p class="p1">4 membered/square ring structure / bond angles of 90&deg;;</p>
<p class="p1">ring under stress/strain / increased (chemical) reactivity / ring opens (due to angle of 90&deg; instead of about 109&deg;);</p>
<p class="p1">bonds to/blocks action of enzyme/transpeptidase;</p>
