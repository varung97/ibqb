<div class='specification'>
<p>The principles of chromatography can be demonstrated using paper chromatography to analyse the ink of a pen, using propanone as the mobile phase.</p>
</div>

<div class='question'>
<p>(a) &nbsp; &nbsp; State how you could tell whether the ink was a single substance or a mixture of components.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp; &nbsp; Explain how paper chromatography separates the components.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp; &nbsp; The \({R_{\text{f}}}\) value of the components of the ink could be measured. Define the term \({R_{\text{f}}}\).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp; &nbsp; State <strong>one</strong> factor that would alter the \({R_{\text{f}}}\) value of a particular component.</p>
