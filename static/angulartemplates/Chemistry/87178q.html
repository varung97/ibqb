<p>\({\text{100 c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of a \({\text{1.00 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) solution of hydrochloric acid is added to 2.00 g of small pieces of calcium carbonate at 20 &deg;C. The volume of carbon dioxide produced against time is plotted to give curve <strong>P</strong>.</p>

<p>Which change will produce curve <strong>Q</strong>, given that calcium carbonate is always the limiting reagent?</p>
<p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp; Increasing the volume of the hydrochloric acid to \({\text{200 c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\)</p>
<p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; Increasing the mass of calcium carbonate to 4.00 g</p>
<p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp; Increasing the concentration of the hydrochloric acid to \({\text{2.00 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\)</p>
<p>D. &nbsp; &nbsp; Replacing the 2.00 g of small pieces of calcium carbonate with 2.00 g of larger pieces of calcium carbonate</p>
