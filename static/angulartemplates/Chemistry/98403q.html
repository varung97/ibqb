<p class="p1">Water is an important substance that is abundant on the Earth&rsquo;s surface. Water dissociates according to the following equation.</p>
<p class="p1">\[{{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O(l)}} \rightleftharpoons {{\text{H}}^ + }{\text{(aq)}} + {\text{O}}{{\text{H}}^ - }{\text{(aq)}}\]</p>

<p class="p1">The graph below shows how the volume of carbon dioxide formed varies with time when a hydrochloric acid solution is added to <strong>excess </strong>calcium carbonate in a flask.</p>

<p class="p1">(i) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>State the equilibrium constant expression for the dissociation of water.</p>
<p class="p1">(ii) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>Explain why even a very acidic aqueous solution still has some \({\text{O}}{{\text{H}}^ - }\) ions present in it.</p>
<p class="p1">(iii) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>State and explain the effect of increasing temperature on the equilibrium constant above given that the dissociation of water is an endothermic process.</p>
<p class="p1">(iv) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>The pH of a solution is 2. If its pH is increased to 6, deduce how the hydrogen ion concentration changes.</p>

<p class="p1">(i)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Explain the shape of the curve.</p>
<p class="p1">(ii)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Copy the above graph on your answer sheet and sketch the curve you would obtain if <strong>double </strong>the volume of hydrochloric acid solution of <strong>half </strong>the concentration as in the example above is used instead, with all other variables kept constant from the original. Explain why the shape of the curve is different.</p>
<p class="p1">(iii)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Outline <strong>one </strong>other way in which the rate of this reaction can be studied in a school laboratory. Sketch a graph to illustrate how the selected variable would change with time.</p>
