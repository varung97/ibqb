<p class="p1">(i)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Identify which alcohol gives spectrum 1 and explain your answer by stating which hydrogen atoms in the molecule are responsible for each of the two peaks.</p>
<p class="p1">(ii)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Deduce which alcohol gives spectrum 2. Explain which particular hydrogen atoms in the molecule are responsible for the peaks at 0.9 ppm and 3.4 ppm.</p>

<p class="p1">(i)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Deduce which <strong>two </strong>of the alcohols could produce this spectrum and identify the species responsible for the three peaks.</p>
<p class="p1">(ii)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The spectrum also shows a significant peak at <em>m/z </em>= 31. Suggest which alcohol is responsible for this spectrum and deduce the species responsible for the peak at <em>m/z </em>= 31.</p>
