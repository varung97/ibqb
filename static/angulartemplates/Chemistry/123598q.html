<p>Which best explains why transition metal complexes are coloured?</p>
<p>A. As electrons return to lower energy levels, light of a certain colour is emitted, and the complementary colour is observed.</p>
<p>B. As electrons return to lower energy levels, light of a certain colour is emitted, so the complex appears to have the same colour.</p>
<p>C. As electrons are promoted to higher energy levels, light of a certain colour is absorbed, and the complementary colour is observed.</p>
<p>D. As electrons are promoted to higher energy levels, light of a certain colour is absorbed, so the complex appears to have the same colour.</p>
