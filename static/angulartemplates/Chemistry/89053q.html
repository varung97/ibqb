<p class="p1">Cytochrome oxidase is a complex enzyme that catalyses the reduction of oxygen in the final stage of aerobic respiration. This enzyme is inhibited both by nitrogen(II) oxide, NO, and separately by cyanide ions, \({\text{C}}{{\text{N}}^ - }\). It has been suggested that NO acts competitively while \({\text{C}}{{\text{N}}^ - }\) acts non-competitively in inhibiting the enzyme. Experiments were carried out to test this hypothesis.</p>

<p class="p1">The graph below shows the effect of substrate concentration on the rate of the reaction in the absence of an inhibitor. Draw and label the results of the <strong>two</strong> experiments showing how the rate of the reaction changes in the presence of NO and in the presence of \({\text{C}}{{\text{N}}^ - }\), if the hypothesis is correct.</p>

<p class="p1">The reducing agent in the cytochrome oxidase reaction is a species that can be denoted as \({\text{X}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}\) in the reduced form. Using this notation, deduce an equation for the reaction of \({\text{X}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}\) and \({{\text{O}}_{\text{2}}}\), and outline, using oxidation numbers, why it is a redox reaction.</p>
