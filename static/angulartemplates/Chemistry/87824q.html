<p>A.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Heat energy is released during the reaction and the reactants are more stable than the products.</p>
<p>B.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Heat energy is absorbed during the reaction and the reactants are more stable than the products.</p>
<p>C.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Heat energy is released during the reaction and the products are more stable than the reactants.</p>
<p>D.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Heat energy is absorbed during the reaction and the products are more stable than the reactants.</p>
