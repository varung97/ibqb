<div class='specification'>
<p>The principles of chromatography can be demonstrated using paper chromatography to analyse the ink of a pen, using propanone as the mobile phase.</p>
</div>

<div class='question'>
<p>(a) &nbsp; &nbsp; State how you could tell whether the ink was a single substance or a mixture of components.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp; &nbsp; Explain how paper chromatography separates the components.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp; &nbsp; The \({R_{\text{f}}}\) value of the components of the ink could be measured. Define the term \({R_{\text{f}}}\).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp; &nbsp; State <strong>one</strong> factor that would alter the \({R_{\text{f}}}\) value of a particular component.</p>

<div class='question'>
<p>(a) &nbsp; &nbsp; whether chromatogram had just one spot or number of spots / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p><em>Allow &ldquo;component/dot / OWTTE&rdquo; for spot.</em></p>
<p>(b) &nbsp; &nbsp; different components have different attractions/affinities/bond strengths/solubilities for two phases / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p>components strongly absorbed/adsorbed by stationary phase move less / components weakly absorbed/adsorbed by stationary phase move more / components not very soluble in mobile phase move less / components very soluble in mobile phase move more / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp; &nbsp; distance travelled by component divided by distance travelled by solvent (front);</p>
<p><em>Allow spot/solute for component.</em></p>
<p><em>Accept R</em><sub><em>f </em></sub><em>represented as an equation.</em></p>
<p><em>Do not allow just retention factor.</em></p>
<p>(d) &nbsp; &nbsp; (nature of) solvent (used) / (type of) paper / temperature / pH;</p>
