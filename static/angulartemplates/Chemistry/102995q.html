<p class="p1">A mixture of the amino acids serine (Ser), glutamic acid (Glu) and lysine (Lys) was separated using electrophoresis and a buffer of pH 5.7. A drop containing the mixture was placed in the centre of the paper and a potential difference was applied. The amino acids were developed and the following results were obtained.</p>
