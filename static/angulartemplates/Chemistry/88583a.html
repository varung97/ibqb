<p>concentration of products is much higher than the concentration of reactants / reaction nearly/almost goes to completion / position of equilibrium lies very far to the right / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p><em>Response must indicate the position of equilibrium is far to the right, but </em><strong><em>not</em></strong><em> complete conversion.</em></p>

<p><em>Temperature:</em></p>
<p>rate of reaction/production is slow at low temperature/fast at high temperature / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p>forward reaction is exothermic/backward reaction is endothermic</p>
<p><strong>and</strong></p>
<p>high temperature shifts equilibrium to left/reactants/favours reverse reaction / low temperature shifts equilibrium to right/products/favours forward reaction / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p>450 &deg;C is a compromise temperature / produces a relatively good equilibrium yield at a reasonably fast rate;</p>
<p><em>Pressure:</em></p>
<p>rate of reaction/production is slow at low pressure/fast at high pressure / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p>more moles of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gaseous</span> reactants/less moles of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gaseous</span> products</p>

<p>high pressure shifts equilibrium to right/products/favours forward reaction / low pressure shifts equilibrium to left/reactants/favours reverse reaction / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p>a high yield/good reaction rate is obtained even at low pressure;</p>
<p>high pressure is expensive/dangerous;</p>

<p>(hypothesis is not valid as) equilibrium already nearly goes to completion / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p>(hypothesis is not valid as increase in yield may not be worth) expense of using pure oxygen / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p>(hypothesis is valid as pure oxygen) increases the rate of (the forward) reaction / more \({\text{S}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{3}}}\) produced per hour/day;</p>
