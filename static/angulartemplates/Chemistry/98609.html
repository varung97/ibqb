<div class='question'>
<p class="p1">(a)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bacteria are self-reproducing units while viruses are not / viruses need living hosts/cells to multiply / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p class="p1">bacteria are able to grow/metabolise/feed and excrete / viruses lack metabolic functions;</p>
<p class="p1">bacteria contain various cell subunits/organelles/cell wall (performing specific functions) / viruses consist only of genetic material and protective coating;</p>
<p class="p1">bacteria are (many times) larger than viruses / viruses are smaller than bacteria;</p>
<p class="p1">bacteria have more complex DNA / viruses have simpler DNA;</p>
<p class="p1">viruses mutate/multiply (much) faster than bacteria / bacteria mutate/multiply slower than viruses;</p>
<p class="p1"><em>If comparative term used e.g. smaller what it&rsquo;s compared to is not required.</em></p>
<p class="p1">(b)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;alter cells genetic material so that virus cannot use it to multiply;</p>
<p class="p1">prevent viruses from multiplying by blocking enzyme activity within host cell / inhibit the synthesis of viral components by blocking enzymes inside the cell;</p>
<p class="p1">prevent viruses from entering (human) cell / bind to cellular receptors targeted by viruses / bind to virus-associated proteins/VAPs which target cellular receptors;</p>
<p class="p1">prevent/hinder the release of viruses from the cell;</p>
<p class="p1">(c)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;viruses mutate quickly so adapt to drugs/evade immune system response / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p class="p1">bacteria are more complex and thus can be targeted in more ways / viruses lack subunits/functions targeted by antibacterials / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p class="p1">bacteria can be killed/impaired by simple chemical agents / viruses cannot be killed and must be targeted on genetic level / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p class="p1">different types of bacteria employ similar metabolic processes and thus can be targeted by common antibacterials / each kind of virus usually requires special drugs/approaches / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
