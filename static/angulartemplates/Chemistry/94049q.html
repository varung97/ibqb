<p class="p1">\({\text{50 c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of copper(II) sulfate solution is measured into a plastic cup using a \({\text{100 c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) measuring cylinder. Excess zinc powder is added and the temperature rise that occurs is measured with a &ndash;10 &deg;C to +110 &deg;C thermometer. The enthalpy change for the reaction is then calculated. Which statement is correct?</p>
<p class="p1">A. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>Systematic error will be reduced by repeating the experiment several times and averaging the results.</p>
<p class="p1">B. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>Random error will be reduced by insulating the plastic cup.</p>
<p class="p1">C. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>Random error will be reduced by using a 50 cm<span class="s1">\(^3\) </span>graduated pipette instead of a measuring cylinder.</p>
<p class="p1">D. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>Systematic error will be increased by using a larger volume of copper(II) sulfate solution.</p>
