<p>Consider the following information:</p>
<p>\[\begin{array}{*{20}{l}} {{\text{CaC}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{3}}}{\text{(s)}} \to {\text{CaO(s)}} + {\text{C}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{(g)}}} \\ {\Delta H =&nbsp; + 179{\text{ kJ}}\,{\text{mo}}{{\text{l}}^{ - 1}}} \\ {\Delta S =&nbsp; + 161.0{\text{ J}}\,{{\text{K}}^{ - 1}}{\text{mo}}{{\text{l}}^{ - 1}}} \end{array}\]</p>
<p>What happens to the spontaneity of this reaction as the temperature is increased?</p>
<p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp; The reaction becomes more spontaneous as the temperature is increased.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; The reaction becomes less spontaneous as the temperature is increased.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp; The reaction remains spontaneous at all temperatures.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp; &nbsp; The reaction remains non-spontaneous at all temperatures.</p>
