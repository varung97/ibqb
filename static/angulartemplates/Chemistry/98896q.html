<p class="p1">A feature of some \(^{\text{1}}{\text{H}}\,{\text{NMR}}\) spectra is the electron-withdrawing effect of electronegative atoms. These atoms cause nearby protons to produce peaks at higher chemical shift values, often in the range 2.5 to 4.5 ppm.</p>
<p class="p1">Consider the \(^{\text{1}}{\text{H}}\,{\text{NMR}}\) spectrum of an unknown compound, D, which has a molecular formula \({{\text{C}}_{\text{4}}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{8}}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{2}}}\) and is known to have an absorption in its IR spectrum corresponding to a C=O absorption.</p>

<p class="p1">Use this information and the values in Table 18 of the Data Booklet to deduce the structure of D.</p>
