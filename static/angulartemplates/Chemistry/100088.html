<p class="p1">measure of the relative margin of safety of a drug (for a particular treatment for a typical population) / measure for safe effective treatment;</p>
<p class="p1">\(\frac{{{\text{lethal dose (L}}{{\text{D}}_{{\text{50}}}}{\text{)}}}}{{{\text{therapeutic or effective dose (E}}{{\text{D}}_{{\text{50}}}}{\text{)}}}}\) <strong>/</strong></p>
<p class="p1">ratio of the lethal dose \({\text{(L}}{{\text{D}}_{{\text{50}}}}{\text{)}}\) to the therapeutic or effective dose \({\text{(E}}{{\text{D}}_{{\text{50}}}}{\text{)}}\) / the range of dosage of a drug/its concentration in a bodily system/blood;</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Definition of LD</em><sub><span class="s1"><em>50</em></span></sub><em> and ED</em><sub><span class="s1"><em>50</em></span></sub><em> not required for mark.</em></p>
<p class="p1">wide therapeutic window exists for small effective dose and larger lethal dose / toxicity occurs at much higher concentrations than for successful treatment / a big difference between effective and lethal dose / drugs with wide therapeutic window are safer;</p>
<p class="p1">narrow therapeutic window requires small doses as lethal dose is not large / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
