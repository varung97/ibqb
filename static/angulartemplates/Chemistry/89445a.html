<p class="p1">viruses mutate quickly so adapt to drugs/evade immune system response / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p class="p1">bacteria are more complex and thus can be targeted in more ways / viruses lack sub-units/functions targeted by antibacterials / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p class="p1">different types of bacteria employ similar metabolic processes and thus can be targeted by common antibacterials / each kind of virus usually requires special drugs/approaches / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p class="p1">bacteria can be killed by interfering with cell wall production without attacking host cell / difficult to attack the virus without attacking host cell;</p>
