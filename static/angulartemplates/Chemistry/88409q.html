<p>The acid&ndash;base indicator phenol red, HIn, changes colour from yellow to red over a pH range of 6.6&ndash;8.2. Which statement is correct?</p>
<p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp; In a strongly acidic solution \({\text{[HIn]}} &lt; {\text{[I}}{{\text{n}}^ - }{\text{]}}\).</p>
<p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; The \({\text{p}}{K_{\text{a}}}\) of phenol red is between 6.6 and 8.2.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp; The \({\text{I}}{{\text{n}}^ - }\) ions are yellow.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp; &nbsp; Phenol red would be a suitable indicator for the titration of a strong acid and a weak base.</p>
