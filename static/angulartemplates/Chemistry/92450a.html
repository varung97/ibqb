<p class="p1">ozone depletion requires higher wavelength / oxygen dissociation requires lower wavelength;</p>
<p class="p1"><em>M1 must refer to wavelength. </em></p>
<p class="p1">wavelength inversely proportional to energy / wavelength increases as energy decreases;</p>
<p class="p1">oxygen has double bond/bond order of 2 <strong>and </strong>ozone has bond order of 1.5/intermediate bond between single and double;</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Stating that ozone has resonance or delocalization alone is not sufficient. </em></p>
<p class="p1">ozone weaker bond / O&ndash;O bond energy in ozone lower;</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Accept opposite argument of oxygen for M4.</em></p>
