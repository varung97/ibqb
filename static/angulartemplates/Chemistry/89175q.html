<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">Aluminium and magnesium ions are commonly found in different forms in soil. Magnesium ions are important for plant growth, but aluminium ions may be toxic if absorbed by plants. Both these ions can be precipitated in the soil by the formation of their hydroxides. The \({K_{{\text{sp}}}}\) values for magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide at 298 K are \(1.80 \times {10^{ - 11}}\) and \(3.00 \times {10^{ - 34}}\), respectively.</p>

<p class="p1">Determine the concentration of the magnesium and hydroxide ions in a saturated solution of magnesium hydroxide at 298 K, and calculate its pH. Assume there are no other ions present.</p>
