<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p>Although fossil fuels are considered significant sources of energy, the energy conversion associated with the production of electricity is a very inefficient process, often in the region of only 40% of total possible energy conversion.</p>
<p>Fuel cells provide a much more efficient process, often with a 70% conversion factor.</p>

<p>(i) &nbsp; &nbsp; Identify the two half-equations that take place at the positive electrode (cathode) and negative electrode (anode) in a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell with an <strong>alkaline</strong> electrolyte.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Positive electrode (cathode) half-equation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Negative electrode (anode) half-equation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) &nbsp; &nbsp; State the overall reaction, identifying the states of all species involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(iii) &nbsp; One commercial version of the hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell (with alkaline electrolyte) operates at a temperature of 353 K. The electrodes of the fuel cell are made of graphite but both are covered with a thin layer of platinum. State the function of the platinum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(iv) &nbsp; &nbsp; Outline the function of the thin polymer membrane used in the corresponding hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell with an <strong>acidic </strong>electrolyte.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
