<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">The ozone layer protects living organisms from dangerous UV radiation. In the Earth&rsquo;s stratosphere, ozone is photochemically formed from oxygen by the following two-step process.</p>
<p class="p1">\[\begin{array}{*{20}{l}} {{{\text{O}}_2}\xrightarrow{{{\text{UV light}}}}2{\text{O}} \bullet } \\ {{{\text{O}}_2} + {\text{O}} \bullet \to {{\text{O}}_3}} \end{array}\]</p>

<div class='question'>
<p class="p1">(a)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ozone decomposition can proceed photochemically. Describe, using chemical equations, the two-step mechanism of photochemical decomposition of ozone in the Earth&rsquo;s stratosphere.</p>
<p class="p1">Step 1:</p>
<p class="p1">Step 2:</p>
<p class="p1">(b)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ozone decomposition can also be catalysed by ozone-depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs. State <strong>two </strong>alternatives to CFCs.</p>
