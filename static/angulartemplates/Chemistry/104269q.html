<p class="p1">Raw sewage is the water-carried waste that flows away from a community. If it is discharged untreated into rivers and the sea it causes pollution. Therefore, waste water should be treated before it is discharged.</p>
<p class="p1">Phosphate ions are one of the pollutants removed from sewage water by chemical precipitation using calcium ions.</p>
<p class="p1">The solubility product, \({K_{{\text{sp}}}}\), of calcium phosphate, \({\text{C}}{{\text{a}}_{\text{3}}}{{\text{(P}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{4}}}{\text{)}}_{\text{2}}}\), is \(1.20 \times {10^{ - 26}}\) at 298 K.</p>
<p class="p1">Determine the concentration of phosphate ions, in \({\text{mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\), in a saturated solution of calcium phosphate.</p>
