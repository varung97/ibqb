<p><em>Absorption spectra</em>:</p>
<p>(when radiation is passed through sample) atom/ion/molecule becomes excited <em>/&nbsp;</em>electrons raised to higher energy level/state / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p>only specific frequencies/wavelengths absorbed / black lines on a coloured background / spectrum shows where absorption happens, such as dips (in the IR spectrum) / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p><em>Emission spectra</em>:</p>
<p>(energy given out by) excited atom/ion/molecule moves to lower energy state / excited electrons move to lower energy level/ground state / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p>colours same as those missing from absorption spectra / coloured lines on black background / only specific frequencies/wavelengths emitted / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p><em>Difference may also be shown by two different representations of spectra.</em></p>
