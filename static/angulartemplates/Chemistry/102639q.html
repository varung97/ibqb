<div class='question'>
<p class="p1">Industrial effluent is found to be highly contaminated with silver and lead ions. A sample of water contains \(8.0 \times {10^{ - 3}}{\text{ mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}{\text{ A}}{{\text{g}}^ + }\) and \(1.9 \times {10^{ - 2}}{\text{ mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}{\text{ P}}{{\text{b}}^{2 + }}\). On the addition of chloride ions both \({\text{AgCl }}({K_{sp}} = 1.8 \times {10^{ - 10}})\) and \({\text{PbC}}{{\text{l}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{ }}({K_{sp}} = 1.7 \times {10^{ - 5}})\) precipitate from the solution. Determine the concentration of \({\text{C}}{{\text{l}}^ - }\) needed to initiate the precipitation of each salt and deduce which salt precipitates first.</p>
