<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p>Waste water from an abandoned copper mine is suspected of polluting a community&rsquo;s drinking water supply, causing concern that the concentration of dissolved copper compounds might exceed the legal limit of 1.3 ppm.</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p>The concentration of transition metal ions can also be determined by measuring the colour intensity of solutions of their complex ions. In the case of copper(II) ions, excess aqueous ammonia is sometimes added before measuring the absorption.</p>
</div>

<div class='question'>
<p>(i) &nbsp; &nbsp; Describe why adding excess ammonia to aqueous copper(II) ions causes the shade of the blue colour to change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;State <strong>one </strong>other factor, apart from a change of ligand, which could affect the colour of a transition metal complex.</p>

<div class='question'>
<p>(i)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ligands cause splitting of d-orbitals;</p>
<p>colour depends on movement of electrons between d-orbitals;</p>
<p>(four of the) water ligands replaced by ammonia;</p>
<p>splitting of orbitals depends on the ligand present;</p>
<p>ammonia ligands increase the splitting of the d-orbitals / cause a greater splitting than water ligands / ammonia higher than water in spectrochemical series;</p>
<p><em>Accept &ldquo;Ammonia affects splitting of d-orbitals&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p>spectrum moves to the blue end / absorbs a higher frequency/shorter wavelength;</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;oxidation state/number of the metal/charge on metal ion/charge density;</p>
<p><em>Accept &ldquo;metal ion involved / geometry of the complex ion / coordination&nbsp;</em><em>number of ligands of metal ion&rdquo;.</em></p>
