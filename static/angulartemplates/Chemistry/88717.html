<div class='specification'>
<p>The cumene process is used for the production of both propanone and phenol. The overall reaction is shown in the equation below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../../../../../../ib-questionbank-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/tinymce_asset/asset/1797/Schermafbeelding_2016-08-23_om_17.08.44.png" alt="N14/4/CHEMI/SP3/ENG/TZ0/26" /></p>
<p>This process is important in the polymer industry. Propanone can be converted into methyl methacrylate, the monomer used to make Perspex<sup>&reg;</sup>, and phenol is used in phenol-methanal resins, which are important thermosetting plastics.</p>

<p>Propanone could also be formed from propene by reaction with steam over an acidic catalyst, followed by oxidation of the product.</p>
<p>The reaction of propene with water can yield two possible products. Explain, in terms of the stability of the intermediate carbocations, why one is formed in much greater quantities than the other.</p>

<p>one product involves a primary carbocation <strong>and </strong>other a secondary carbocation;</p>
<p>secondary carbocation is more stable (than the primary carbocation, and hence this produces the major product);</p>
<p>alkyl groups reduce charge on carbon atom (through an inductive effect);</p>
<p><em>Positive inductive effect of alkyl groups alone not enough for M3.</em></p>
