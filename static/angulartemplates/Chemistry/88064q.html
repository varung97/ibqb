<div class='specification'>
<p>Although fossil fuels are considered significant sources of energy, the energy conversion associated with the production of electricity is a very inefficient process, often in the region of only 40% of total possible energy conversion.</p>
<p>Fuel cells provide a much more efficient process, often with a 70% conversion factor.</p>
