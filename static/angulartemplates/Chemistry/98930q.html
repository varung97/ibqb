<p class="p1">When some solid barium hydroxide and solid ammonium thiosulfate were reacted together, the temperature of the surroundings was observed to decrease from 15 &deg;C to &ndash;4 &deg;C. What can be deduced from this observation?</p>
<p class="p1">A. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>The reaction is exothermic and \(\Delta H\) is negative.</p>
<p class="p1">B. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>The reaction is exothermic and \(\Delta H\) is positive.</p>
<p class="p1">C. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>The reaction is endothermic and \(\Delta H\) is negative.</p>
<p class="p1">D. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>The reaction is endothermic and \(\Delta H\) is positive.</p>
