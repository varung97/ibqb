<div class='question'>
<p class="p1">Heavy metal ions can be removed by adding hydroxide ions. When hydroxide ions are added to a solution containing nickel ions, a precipitate of nickel(II) hydroxide, \({\text{Ni(OH}}{{\text{)}}_{\text{2}}}\), is formed. The solubility product of nickel(II) hydroxide is \(6.50 \times {10^{ - 18}}\) at 298 K. Determine the mass of nickel ions that remains in one litre (\({\text{1.00 d}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\)) of water at 298 K with a pH of 7 after the precipitation reaction has occurred.</p>
