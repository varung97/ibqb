<p class="p1">Alex and Hannah were asked to investigate the kinetics involved in the iodination of propanone. They were given the following equation by their teacher.</p>
<p>\[{\text{C}}{{\text{H}}_3}{\text{COC}}{{\text{H}}_3}{\text{(aq)}} + {{\text{I}}_2}{\text{(aq)}}\xrightarrow{{{{\text{H}}^ + }{\text{(aq)}}}}{\text{C}}{{\text{H}}_2}{\text{ICOC}}{{\text{H}}_3}{\text{(aq)}} + {\text{HI(aq)}}\]</p>
<p class="p1">Alex&rsquo;s hypothesis was that the rate will be affected by changing the concentrations of the propanone and the iodine, as the reaction can happen without a catalyst. Hannah&rsquo;s hypothesis was that as the catalyst is involved in the reaction, the concentrations of the propanone, iodine and the hydrogen ions will all affect the rate.</p>
<p class="p1">They carried out several experiments varying the concentration of one of the reactants or the catalyst whilst keeping other concentrations and conditions the same, and obtained the results below.</p>
