<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;'>
<p class="p1">Describe the characteristics of an enzyme such as pepsin, and compare its catalytic behaviour to an inorganic catalyst such as iron.</p>

<p class="p1">Enzymes are affected by inhibitors. Lead ions are a non-competitive inhibitor, they have been linked to impaired mental functioning. Ritonavir<sup><span class="s1">&reg; </span></sup>is a drug used to treat HIV and acts as a competitive inhibitor. Compare the action of lead ions and Ritonavir<sup><span class="s1">&reg; </span></sup>on enzymes, and how they affect the initial rate of reaction of the enzyme with its substrate and the values of \({K_{\text{m}}}\) and \({V_{{\text{max}}}}\).</p>
