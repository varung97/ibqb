<p class="p1">enzymes have an active site (where the substrate can bind) / explanation of lock and key or induced fit model;</p>

<p class="p1">increasing temperature initially increases rate of reaction;</p>
<p class="p1">because more molecules possess energies equal or greater than the activation energy;</p>
<p class="p1">at a temperature around 37 &deg;C, the highest rate is reached;</p>
<p class="p1">at a temperature around 40&nbsp;&deg;C&nbsp;the enzyme is denatured / shape of the active site changes/tertiary structure of the enzyme changes;</p>
<p class="p1">so rate decreases/reaction stops;</p>
