<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">Alex and Hannah were asked to investigate the kinetics involved in the iodination of propanone. They were given the following equation by their teacher.</p>
<p class="p1">\[{\text{C}}{{\text{H}}_3}{\text{COC}}{{\text{H}}_3}{\text{(aq)}} + {{\text{I}}_2}{\text{(aq)}}\xrightarrow{{{{\text{H}}^ + }{\text{(aq)}}}}{\text{C}}{{\text{H}}_2}{\text{ICOC}}{{\text{H}}_3}{\text{(aq)}} + {\text{HI(aq)}}\]</p>
<p class="p1">Alex&rsquo;s hypothesis was that the rate will be affected by changing the concentrations of the propanone and the iodine, as the reaction can happen without a catalyst. Hannah&rsquo;s hypothesis was that as the catalyst is involved in the reaction, the concentrations of the propanone, iodine and the hydrogen ions will all affect the rate.</p>
<p class="p1">They carried out several experiments varying the concentration of one of the reactants or the catalyst whilst keeping other concentrations and conditions the same. Their results are shown graphically below.</p>

<div class='question'>
<p class="p1">(a)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Discuss whether either Alex&rsquo;s or Hannah&rsquo;s hypothesis is correct.</p>
<p class="p1">(b)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Explain why the reaction rate will increase with increasing temperature.</p>
<p class="p1">(c)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(i)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This reaction uses a catalyst. Sketch and annotate the Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution curve for a reaction with and without a catalyst on labelled axes below.</p>
<p class="p1">(ii)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Describe how a catalyst works.</p>
