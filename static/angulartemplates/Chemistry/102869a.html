<div class='question'>
<p class="p1">methoxymethane is very weakly polar</p>
<p class="p1">weak van der Waals&rsquo;/dipole-dipole forces exist between methoxymethane molecules;</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Accept alternatives to van der Waals&rsquo; such as London and dispersion forces.</em></p>
<p class="p1">ethanol contains a hydrogen atom bonded directly to an electronegative oxygen atom / hydrogen bonding can occur between two ethanol molecules / intermolecular hydrogen bonding in ethanol;</p>
<p class="p1">the forces of attraction between molecules are stronger in ethanol than in methoxymethane / hydrogen bonding stronger than van der Waals&rsquo;/dipole-dipole attractions;</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Award </em><strong><em>[2 max] </em></strong><em>if covalent bonds breaking during boiling is mentioned in the answer.</em></p>
<p class="p1"><em>Penalize only once if no reference given to intermolecular nature of hydrogen bonding or&nbsp;</em><em>van der Waal is missing.</em></p>
