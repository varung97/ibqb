<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">A large proportion of the food we eat provides energy through the process of respiration. Carbohydrates and triglycerides are the food groups mainly responsible for providing this energy.</p>
</div>

<div class='question'>
<p class="p1">Compare the behaviour of enzymes and inorganic catalysts, including reference to the mechanism of enzyme action and the ways in which this can be inhibited.</p>
</div>
<h2 style='margin-top: 1em'>Markscheme</h2>
<div class='question'>
<p class="p1"><em>Any three for first three marks: </em></p>
<p class="p1">both increase rate of chemical reactions;</p>
<p class="p1">both reduce activation energy;</p>
<p class="p1">both provide alternative pathways for reaction;</p>
<p class="p1">enzymes more specific;</p>
<p class="p1">enzymes have active site that substrate bonds to / &ldquo;lock and key&rdquo; mechanism;</p>
<p class="p1">enzymes much more readily denatured by changing conditions;</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Both required for final two marks: </em></p>
<p class="p1">competitive inhibitors <strong>and </strong>non-competitive inhibitors;</p>
<p class="p1">competitive inhibitors bond to active site <strong>and </strong>non-competitive inhibitors denature/alter shape of enzyme;</p>
