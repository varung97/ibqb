<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p>Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) produces multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) of a&nbsp;more appropriate size for use in liquid crystals than production by arc discharge.</p>
</div>

<div class='question'>
<p>MWCNT are very small in size and can greatly increase switching speeds in a liquid crystal allowing the liquid crystal to change orientation quickly.</p>
<p>Discuss <strong>two other </strong>properties a substance should have to be suitable for use in liquid crystal displays.</p>
