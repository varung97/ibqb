<p class="p1">(nematic) LC&rsquo;s placed between (two glass) plates/sheets with (two) polarizing filters at 90<span class="s1">&deg; </span>to each other / each pixel contains LC (film/molecules) sandwiched between (two glass) plates/sheets;</p>
<p class="p1">plates/sheets have (fine) scratches/grooves <strong>and </strong>LC molecules (in contact with glass) align with these;</p>
<p class="p1">LC molecules adjacent to top layer are orientated at 90<span class="s1">&deg; </span>to those adjacent to bottom layer / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
<p class="p1">LC molecules align in twisted (nematic) arrangement due to intermolecular forces;</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Accept &ldquo;intermolecular bonds&rdquo; for &ldquo;intermolecular forces&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p class="p1">LC interacts with (plane-)polarized light which is rotated 90&deg;;</p>
<p class="p1">when molecules are aligned (with the scratches) light will pass through (and pixel appears bright);</p>
<p class="p1">when a potential difference/voltage is applied molecules align with electric field (losing their twisted structure);</p>
<p class="p1">they no longer allow (polarized) light to pass (and pixel appears dark);</p>
<p class="p1"><em>A suitably labelled diagram may be used to explain some marking points</em>.</p>
