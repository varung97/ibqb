<p>What is the reason why the rate of the reaction with activation energy \({E_{{\text{a2}}}}\) is greater?</p>
<p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp; More frequent collisions between the particles occur.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; More energetic collisions between the particles occur.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp; A catalyst has been added.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp; &nbsp; The temperature is higher.</p>
