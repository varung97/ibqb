<p class="p1">Copper(II) sulfate forms a pale blue aqueous solution. When aqueous ammonia is added to this, initially a pale blue precipitate forms; this precipitate then dissolves in excess ammonia to form a deep blue solution. Explain why these solutions are coloured and the colour with excess ammonia is a deeper blue.</p>

<p class="p1">electron transitions between (split, partially filled) d orbitals;</p>
<p class="p1">absorption depends on energy difference between the split d orbitals;</p>
<p class="p1">waters replaced by ammonias;</p>
<p class="p1">ammonia (ligands) increase the splitting between the d orbitals/larger energy difference;</p>
<p class="p1">absorption moves to shorter wavelength/higher frequency/towards blue end of spectrum;</p>
