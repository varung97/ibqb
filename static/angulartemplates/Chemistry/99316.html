<p class="p1">main cylinder is made only from carbon hexagons, with pentagons required to close the structure at the ends;</p>
<p class="p1">single or multiple walled tubes made from concentric nanotubes can be formed;</p>
<p class="p1">bundles of the tubes have high tensile strength;</p>
<p class="p1">other substances (elements, metal oxides etc.) can be inserted inside the tubes;</p>
<p class="p1">strong covalent bonding / no weak bonds;</p>
<p class="p1">behaviour of electrons depends on the length of a tube and hence some forms are conductors and some are semiconductors;</p>
