<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">Enzymes are protein molecules that catalyse specific biochemical reactions. The phosphorylation of glucose is the first step of glycolysis (the oxidation of glucose) and is catalysed by the enzyme hexokinase.</p>
</div>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;'>
<p class="p1">Explain how enzymes, such as hexokinase, are able to catalyse reactions.</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;'>
<p class="p1">State and explain the effect of increasing the temperature from 20 &deg;C to 60 &deg;C on an enzyme-catalysed reaction.</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p class="p1">enzymes have an active site (where the substrate can bind) / explanation of lock and key or induced fit model;</p>
<p class="p1">lowers activation energy (by providing an alternative pathway);</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>a.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p class="p1">increasing temperature initially increases rate of reaction;</p>
<p class="p1">because more molecules possess energies equal or greater than the activation energy;</p>
<p class="p1">at a temperature around 37 &deg;C, the highest rate is reached;</p>
<p class="p1">at a temperature around 40&nbsp;&deg;C&nbsp;the enzyme is denatured / shape of the active site changes/tertiary structure of the enzyme changes;</p>
<p class="p1">so rate decreases/reaction stops;</p>
