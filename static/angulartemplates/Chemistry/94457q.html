<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='question'>
<p>A voltaic cell is made by connecting two half-cells represented by the half-equations below.</p>
<p>\[\begin{array}{*{20}{l}} {{\text{M}}{{\text{n}}^{2 + }}{\text{(aq)}} + {\text{2}}{{\text{e}}^ - } \to {\text{Mn(s)}}}&amp;{{E^\Theta } =&nbsp; - 1.19{\text{ V}}} \\ {{\text{P}}{{\text{b}}^{2 + }}{\text{(aq)}} + {\text{2}}{{\text{e}}^ - } \to {\text{Pb(s)}}}&amp;{{E^\Theta } =&nbsp; - 0.13{\text{ V}}} \end{array}\]</p>
<p>Which statement is correct about this voltaic cell?</p>
<p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp; Mn is oxidized and the voltage of the cell is 1.06 V.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; Pb is oxidized and the voltage of the cell is 1.06 V.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp; Mn is oxidized and the voltage of the cell is 1.32 V.</p>
