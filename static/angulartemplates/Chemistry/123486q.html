<div class='specification'>
<p>A student wished to determine the concentration of a solution of sodium hydroxide by titrating it against a 0.100moldm<sup>&minus;3</sup> aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid.</p>
<p>4.00g of sodium hydroxide pellets were used to make 1.00dm<sup>3</sup> aqueous solution.</p>
<p>20.0cm<sup>3</sup> samples of the sodium hydroxide solution were titrated using bromothymol blue as the indicator.</p>
</div>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;'>
<p>Outline, giving your reasons, how you would carefully prepare the 1.00dm<sup>3</sup> aqueous solution from the 4.00g sodium hydroxide pellets.</p>

<p>(i) State the colour change of the indicator that the student would see during his titration using section 22 of the data booklet.</p>
<p>(ii) The student added the acid too quickly. Outline, giving your reason, how this could have affected the calculated concentration.</p>
