<p class="p1">An increase in temperature increases the amount of chlorine present in the following equilibrium.</p>
<p class="p1">\[{\text{PC}}{{\text{l}}_5}({\text{s)}} \rightleftharpoons {\text{PC}}{{\text{l}}_3}({\text{l)}} + {\text{C}}{{\text{l}}_2}({\text{g)}}\]</p>
<p class="p1">What is the best explanation for this?</p>
<p class="p1">A. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>The higher temperature increases the rate of the forward reaction only.</p>
<p class="p1">B. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>The higher temperature increases the rate of the reverse reaction only.</p>
<p class="p1">C. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>The higher temperature increases the rate of both reactions but the forward reaction is affected more than the reverse.</p>
<p class="p1">D. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>The higher temperature increases the rate of both reactions but the reverse reaction is affected more than the forward.</p>
