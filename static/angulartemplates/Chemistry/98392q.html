<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">The percentage by mass of calcium carbonate in eggshell was determined by adding excess hydrochloric acid to ensure that all the calcium carbonate had reacted. The excess acid left was then titrated with aqueous sodium hydroxide.</p>

<p class="p1">(a) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>A student added \({\text{27.20 c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of \({\text{0.200 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) HCl to 0.188 g of eggshell. Calculate the amount, in mol, of HCl added.</p>
<p class="p1">(b) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>The excess acid requires \({\text{23.80 c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of \({\text{0.100 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) NaOH for neutralization. Calculate the amount, in mol, of acid that is in excess.</p>
