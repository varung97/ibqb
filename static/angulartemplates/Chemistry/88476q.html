<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p>Waste water from an abandoned copper mine is suspected of polluting a community&rsquo;s drinking water supply, causing concern that the concentration of dissolved copper compounds might exceed the legal limit of 1.3 ppm.</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p>The concentration of transition metal ions can also be determined by measuring the colour intensity of solutions of their complex ions. In the case of copper(II) ions, excess aqueous ammonia is sometimes added before measuring the absorption.</p>
</div>

<div class='question'>
<p>(i) &nbsp; &nbsp; Describe why adding excess ammonia to aqueous copper(II) ions causes the shade of the blue colour to change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;State <strong>one </strong>other factor, apart from a change of ligand, which could affect the colour of a transition metal complex.</p>
</div>
