<p>Thalidomide is currently used to treat several different diseases including certain types of cancer. Research to compare its effectiveness with other cancer drugs, such as doxorubicin, is ongoing.</p>
<p>(i) &nbsp; &nbsp; Doxorubicin contains six different chiral carbon atoms. Three of them are identifi ed with an asterisk, *. Identify the locations of the other three by placing circles around the relevant carbon atoms.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="static/tinymce_asset/1616/Schermafbeelding_2016-08-15_om_08.26.06.png" alt="M14/4/CHEMI/HP3/ENG/TZ1/14.b.i" /></p>
<p>(ii) &nbsp; &nbsp; Only one of the possible enantiomers is really effective as an anti-cancer drug.</p>
<p>Describe the general principles behind the use of chiral auxiliaries to form the desired enantiomer when several different enantiomers of a drug exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(iii) &nbsp; &nbsp; From its structure it can be seen that doxorubicin contains several polar hydroxyl groups. However, when it is given intravenously it needs to be in an ionic form to make it even more soluble in an aqueous medium. Describe how doxorubicin can be converted into a salt.</p>
