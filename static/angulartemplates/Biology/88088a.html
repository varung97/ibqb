<p>a. (both) atria collect blood (from veins);<br />b. sinoatrial/SA node sends impulses to muscle/fibres initiating contraction;<br />c. blood is pushed to ventricles by contraction of atria/atrial systole;<br />d. AV (atrioventricular) valves are open (as atria contract);<br />e. semilunar valves are closed so that ventricles fill with blood;<br />f. ventricles contract / ventricular systole;<br />g. AV (atrioventricular) valves close ( preventing backflow);<br />h. (blood is pushed through the) semilunar valves/pulmonary artery and aorta;<br />i. when ventricles relax /diastole, semilunar valves close preventing backflow of blood;</p>
<p><em>Do not accept the description of blood flow without a clear action.</em><br /><em>Do not accept general statements such as systole = heart contraction and </em><em>diastole = heart relaxation.</em><br /><em><strong>[4 max]</strong> if answer suggests that left and right sides are contracting at different </em><em>times or simultaneous contraction not indicated.</em><br /><em><br /></em></p>

<p>a. higher nitrogen/urea as blood enters nephron/Bowman&rsquo;s capsule than when it leaves the nephron (in the renal vein);<br />b. most small soluble molecules/glucose/nutrients/ions are removed from blood in Bowman&rsquo;s capsule;<br />c. through ultrafiltration;<br />d. proteins / blood cells / large molecules remain in the blood;<br />e. as filtrate moves through the nephron (tubule), water is returned to the blood (by osmosis);<br />f. glucose/nutrients is returned to blood by active transport (and diffusion) / selective reabsorption;<br />g. in the proximal convoluted tubule;<br />h. urea / uric acid remain in the filtrate / removed from blood;<br />i. sodium is pumped into the medulla in the loop of Henl&eacute;;<br />j. water reabsorption is enhanced by a high sodium gradient (in the medulla);<br />k. permeability of the collecting duct membrane is regulated by hormones / ADH;<br />l. water concentration in urine is variable to maintain homeostasis in the blood;<br />m. more oxygen/less carbon dioxide in blood entering (kidney) than in blood leaving (kidney);<em> <br /></em></p>
