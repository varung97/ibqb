<p>a. PCR is process by which a small sample of DNA can be amplified/copied many times&nbsp;</p>
<p>b. PCR involves repeated cycling through high and lower temperatures &laquo;to promote melting and annealing of DNA strands&raquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>c. &laquo;mixture&raquo; is heated to high temperatures to break &laquo;hydrogen&raquo; bonds between strands of DNA/to separate the double-stranded DNA&nbsp;</p>
<p>d. Taq DNA polymerase can withstand high temperatures without denaturing&nbsp;</p>
<p>e. primers bind to &laquo;targeted&raquo; DNA sequences at lower temp&nbsp;</p>
<p>f. Taq DNA polymerase forms new &laquo;double-stranded&raquo; DNA by adding &laquo;complementary&raquo; bases/nucleotides</p>

<p><em>Environment benefits:</em></p>
<p>a. pest-resistant crops can be made&nbsp;</p>
<p>b. so less spraying of insecticides/pesticides&nbsp;</p>
<p>c. less fuel burned in management of crops</p>
<p>d. longer shelf-life for fruits and vegetables so less spoilage&nbsp;</p>
<p>e. greater quantity/shorter growing time/less land needed&nbsp;</p>
<p>f. increase variety of growing locations / can grow in threatened conditions</p>
<p><em>Environment risks:</em></p>
<p>g. non-target organisms can be affected&nbsp;</p>
<p>h. genes transferred to crop plants to make them herbicide resistant could spread to wild plants making super-weeds&nbsp;</p>
<p>i. GMOs (encourage monoculture which) reduces biodiversity&nbsp;</p>
<p>j. GM crops encourage overuse of herbicides</p>
<p><em>Health benefits:</em></p>
<p>k. nutritional value of food improved by increasing nutrient content&nbsp;</p>
<p>l. crops could be produced that lack toxins or allergens&nbsp;</p>
<p>m. crops could be produced to contain edible vaccines to provide natural disease resistance</p>
<p><em>Health risks:</em></p>
<p>n. proteins from transferred genes could be toxic or cause allergic reactions&nbsp;</p>
<p>o. antibiotic resistance genes used as markers during gene transfer could spread to &laquo;pathogenic&raquo; bacteria&nbsp;</p>
<p>p. transferred genes could cause unexpected/not anticipated problems <br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em> <br />health effects of exposure to GMO unclear</p>
