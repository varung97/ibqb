<div class='question'>
<p>a. (white) light is a mix of different wavelengths which correspond to different colours seen </p>
<p>b. light hits the back of the eye /retina </p>
<p>c. cones are photoreceptors in the retina/concentrated in fovea </p>
<p>d. cone cells are sensitive to a specific wavelength/specific colours/contain different pigments </p>
<p>e. three types of cone cells respond to red, blue or green light </p>
<p>f. different colours are perceived by the relative degree of stimulation of different cone cells </p>
<p>g. single cone cell passes impulses to a single nerve fibre/ganglion cell </p>
<p>h. (stimulation of) cones require bright light/ colour vision is less in dim light </p>
<p>i. genetic disorders can cause absence of red/green/some pigments / colour blindness</p>
