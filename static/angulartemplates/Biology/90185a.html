<p>a. <em>codominant allele</em>: (pair of) alleles that both affect the phenotype when present in a heterozygote / both alleles are expressed;<br />b. <em>recessive allele:</em> an allele that produces its characteristic phenotype only when present in homozygous state / is expressed when dominant allele not present;<br />c. <em>locus:</em> the (particular) position of a gene on a chromosome/homologous chromosomes;<br />d. <em>sex linkage:</em> a gene located on a sex chromosome/X/Y/X or Y chromosome;</p>

<p><em>Example / annotated Punnett grid showing a cross between blood groups showing:</em><br />a. parental genotype (for example I<sup>A</sup>i and I<sup>B</sup>i therefore A and B phenotypes);<br />b. gametes of one parent; (shown in Punnett grid)<br />c. gametes of other parent; (shown in Punnett grid)<br />d. genotypes of offspring; (shown in Punnett grid)<br />e. phenotypes of offspring expressed as a ratio or possibly in the Punnett grid;<br />f. blood group different to parent shown and identified (ie ii is blood group O);<br /><em>Award <strong>[4 max]</strong> if correct notation not used.</em><br /><em>Award <strong>[2 max]</strong> if Punnett grid is not used.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>NB</strong> Other possible crosses could be used as long as the offspring include one </em><em>or more offspring of a different phenotype from either of the parents.</em></p>

<p>a. hemophilia is due to a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">recessive</span> allele/is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">recessive</span> trait / X<sup>H</sup> is normal allele and X<sup>h</sup> is hemophilia allele;<br />b. hemophilia is sex linked;<br />c. allele/gene is on the X chromosome;<br /><em>Reject disease/hemophilia carried on X chromosome.</em><br />d. (sex chromosomes in) females are XX while males are XY;<br />e. Y chromosomes do not have the allele/hemophiliac males are X<sup>h</sup>Y;<br />f. males inherit their X chromosome from their mother/do not pass the allele to sons;<br />g. males have only one copy so recessive trait/allele is not masked;<br />h. males have a 50 % chance of hemophilia/receiving the allele if mother is a carrier;<br />i. carrier is heterozygous for the gene/is X<sup>H</sup>X<sup>h</sup>;<br />j. dominant/normal allele masks the recessive allele (so clotting is normal);<br />k. females inherit one X chromosome from father and one from mother;<br />l. affected/hemophiliac males have carrier daughters;<br />m. hemophilia allele could have been inherited from either parent; <br /><em>Accept the points above explained either in text or clearly using a Punnett grid or genetic diagram but not for simply reproducing an unlabelled Punnett grid or diagram without explanation.</em></p>
