<p>a. molecules move by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">diffusion</span> / move down a concentration gradient</p>
<p>b. nutrients move into tissues</p>
<p>c. gas exchange / Oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange between tissues and blood/capillaries</p>
<p>d. (nitrogenous) wastes/excess water move from cells/tissues into blood/capillaries</p>
<p>e. hormones leave capillaries in target tissues/to attach to receptors on cells / (endocrine) organs/gland tissues release hormones into the bloodstream</p>

<p>a. arteries and veins have three layers in their walls<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />walls of arteries and veins have tunica externa, media and intima</p>
<p>b. pressure is high in arteries/pressure is low in veins</p>
<p>c. arteries receive blood from ventricles/heart / carry blood away from heart</p>
<p>d. lumen of artery is small to keep pressure high</p>
<p>e. arteries have thick (muscular) walls (with elastic fibres) to withstand pressure</p>
<p>f. elastic fibres recoil in response to ventricle/heart contraction</p>
<p>g. muscle / elastic fibres help maintain pressure between heartbeats<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />muscle / elastic fibres help propel blood toward capillary beds</p>
<p>h. veins receive blood from capillaries/capillary beds / carry blood to heart</p>
<p>i. large lumen of veins so there is less resistance to blood flow</p>
<p>j. valves in veins keep blood flowing toward heart/prevent backflow</p>
