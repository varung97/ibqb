<p><em>cons/negative considerations: <strong>[3 max]</strong></em><br />IVF is expensive and might not be equally accessible;<br />success rate is low therefore it is stressful for the couple;<br />it is not natural/cultural/religious objections;<br />could lead to eugenics/gender choice;<br />could lead to (unwanted) multiple pregnancies with associated risks;<br />production and storage of unused embryos / associated legal issues / extra embryos may be used for (stem cell) research;<br />inherited forms of infertility might be passed on to children; <br /><em>Accept any other reasonable answers.</em></p>
