<p><em>Accept any of the following points about the female:</em><br />older so (possibly) has a lower metabolic rate / other result of age;<br />higher surface area to volume ratio (than male);<br />less active than males so releasing less metabolic heat;<br />less insulation due to subcutaneous fat/adipose tissue;<br />suckling / pregnant / part of mass was fetus;</p>

<p>supported as water temperature affects metabolic rate;<br />supported as dolphins will avoid areas with water below their LCT<sub>w</sub>;<br />water temperature is unlikely to be a factor for bigger males;<br />wide (latitude) range in summer suggests temperature does not determine range;<br />few animals / only one female / only narrow range of latitudes investigated;<br />data may not be reliable since the study was conducted in captivity;</p>
