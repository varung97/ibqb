<p>organism expends time/energy in caring for other (unrelated) members of the same species;<br />put themselves at risk or disadvantage for the good of other members of the species / actions that increase another individual&rsquo;s number of offspring at cost to one&rsquo;s own reproduction;</p>
<p>valid example; (<em>e.g. primates / vampire bats / male turkeys or other birds such as Florida jays / mole rats</em>)<br /><em>Do not accept parental care.</em></p>
<p>description of altruistic behaviour of the example given;<br />might expect natural selection to be against behaviour that reduces chances of survival and reproduction;<br />close kin share alleles;<br />(adaptive significance is to) increase frequency of alleles shared in common;<br />(provides genetic advantages in kin by) promoting survival and reproduction within species;<br />altruistic behaviour towards non-relatives may allow selection of alleles responsible for the behaviour to be perpetuated;<br />some argue no true altruism as organism benefits either directly or indirectly in the future; <em><br />Award <strong>[5 max]</strong> if no valid non-human example given.</em></p>
