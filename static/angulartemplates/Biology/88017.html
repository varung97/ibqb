<p>a. (the genetic code is based on) sets of three nucleotides/triplets of bases called codons;<br />b. bases include adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine in DNA / adenine, guanine, cytosine and uracil in RNA; (do not accept ATCG)<br />c. each codon is code for one amino acid;<br />d. some codons are (start or) stop codons;<br />e. DNA is transcribed into mRNA by base-pair matching/complementary base pairing;<br />f. mRNA is translated into a sequence of amino acids/polypeptide;<br />g. each gene codes for a polypeptide;<br />h. polypeptides may be joined/modified to form proteins;</p>

<p>a. channel proteins allow diffusion/osmosis/passive transport;<br />b. large/polar molecules cannot cross the (hydrophobic) membrane freely;<br />c. facilitated diffusion involves moving molecules through proteins down their concentration gradient/without requiring ATP;<br />d. aquaporins (specific integral membrane proteins) facilitate the movement of water molecules/osmosis;<br />e. some proteins (for facilitated diffusion) are specific to molecule/ions;<br />f. active transport involves moving molecules through proteins against their concentration gradient/requiring ATP;<br />g. (some) proteins in the membrane are pumps / pumps perform active transport / sodium potassium pump;</p>

<p>a. ATP is a form of energy currency/immediately available for use;<br />b. ATP is generated in cells by cell respiration (from organic compounds);<br />c. aerobic (cell respiration) requires oxygen;<br />d. anaerobic (cell respiration) does not require oxygen;<br />e. glycolysis breaks down glucose into pyruvate;<br />f. glycolysis occurs in cytoplasm;<br />g. (by glycolysis) a small amount of ATP is released;<br />h. ADP changes into ATP with the addition of a phosphate group/phosphoric acid / accept as chemical equation;<br />i. in mitochondria/aerobic respiration produces large amount of ATP / 38 mols (for the cell, per glucose molecule);<br />j. oxygen/aerobic respiration is required for mitochondrial production of ATP;<br />k. in mitochondria/aerobic respiration pyruvate is broken down into carbon dioxide and water;</p>
