<p><em>Arguments supporting the need for adjustment:</em><br />a. (blood) pressure increased but then decreased later in flight;<br />b. time between heartbeats (at rest) increased then decreased / heart rate decreased then increased;</p>
<p><em>Arguments not supporting the need for adjustment:</em><br />c. (blood) pressure/time between heartbeats/heart rate does not change (much) in space;<br />d. data is from a few trained astronauts and may not reflect general population / <em>OWTTE</em>;<br />e. data for more extended periods of time not included (so difficult to evaluate); <br /><em>Award <strong>[2 max]</strong> if only one perspective is presented.</em></p>
