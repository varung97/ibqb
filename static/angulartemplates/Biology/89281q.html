<p align="LEFT">In a fruit fly experiment, grey body, normal winged (homozygous dominant) fruit flies were mated with black body, short winged (homozygous recessive) fruit flies. The F<sub>1 </sub>dihybrid females were then used in a test cross. If the genes are always linked and no crossing over occurs, what would be the predicted ratio in the F<sub>2 </sub>generation?</p>
<p align="LEFT">A. 9 : 3 : 3 : 1</p>

<p align="LEFT">C. 3 : 1</p>
<p>D. 1 : 1</p>
