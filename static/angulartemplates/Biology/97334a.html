<p>both birds show an increase in mass at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Site 1</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> a decrease at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Site 2</span>;<br />MW has a greater increase than HT at Site 1; (<em>do not accept larger/greater change</em>)<br />MW has a greater decrease than HT at Site 2; (<em>accept negative change</em>)<br />MW has larger mass change at both sites/Site 1 and Site 2; <em><br />Do not accept answers quoting only numerical statements.</em></p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>HT data is reliable whereas AR data is unreliable / differences not significant / uncertainty higher with AR;<br />(because) error bars/variation/range/standard deviation large for AR / larger for AR than for HT;<br />(because) smaller sample of AR than of HT; <em><br />Do not accept comments about whether the data is accurate or not.</em></p>

<p>all have a higher concentration of triglyceride at Site 1 than at Site 2;<br />HT (and WS) highest at both sites/at Site 1;<br />MW lowest at Site 1 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> AR lowest at Site 2; <em><br />Do not allow answers quoting only numerical statements.</em></p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>triglyceride higher at Site 1 because more fat deposition / HT eats more;<br />butyrate higher at Site 2 because more fat/triglyceride utilized / HT fasts more;</p>

</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>(data supports hypothesis) because mean mass at Site 1 is greater than at Site 2 (for all birds);<br />because mass gained at Site 1 but mass falls (mostly) at Site 2 (over 17 years);<br />because triglyceride levels higher at Site 1 / butyrate levels higher at Site 2 / more fat deposited at Site 1 / more fat utilized at Site 2 / more fasting at Site 2;</p>

<p><em>advantage:</em><br />need to capture bird only once to get data / no need to mark and catch birds again;<br />more informative data can be gathered; (<em>do not accept unqualified &ldquo;more precise&rdquo;</em>)</p>
<p><em>disadvantage:</em><br />removal of blood is more stressful/risky for the bird than weighing;<br />danger of infection / spread of disease / harm to birds;<br />extra time/money/laboratory equipment is needed to analyse results;<br />could include fat/triglyceride/butyrate from previous/long-term feeding;<br />nutrients from food eaten at these sites may not have been absorbed yet; <br /><em>Award <strong>[1]</strong> for one advantage and one disadvantage that are not the converse </em><em>of each other.
