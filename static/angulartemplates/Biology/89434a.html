<p>b. cytoplasm &ndash; with nucleus-to-membrane distance &gt;4 times nucleus diameter;</p>
<p>c. centrioles &ndash; two must be shown but only one needs to be labelled;</p>
<p>d. cortical granules &ndash; needs to be drawn in vicinity of plasma membrane;</p>
<p>e. plasma membrane &ndash; shown as a single line and approximately circular overall;</p>
<p>f. polar cell / (first) polar body &ndash; needs to be drawn outside the egg cell;</p>
<p>g. zona pellucida / layer of gel (outside the cell membrane);</p>
<p>h. follicle cells / corona radiata (outside the cell membrane);</p>
<p>i. size shown as 100 &mu;m/0.1mm; <em>(accept 90 &mu;m to 120 &mu;m) </em></p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. plasmid used for gene transfer/removed from bacteria;</p>
<p>b. plasmid is a small/extra circle of DNA;</p>
<p>c. restriction enzymes/endonucleases cut/cleave DNA (of plasmid);</p>
<p>d. each restriction enzyme cuts at specific base sequence/creates sticky ends;</p>
<p>e. same (restriction) enzyme used to cut DNA with (desired) gene;</p>
<p>f. DNA/gene can be added to the open plasmid/sticky ends join gene and plasmid;</p>
<p>g. (DNA) ligase used to splice/join together/seal nicks;</p>
<p>h. recombinant DNA/plasmids inserted into host cell/bacterium/yeast;</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. variation in population;</p>
<p>b. (variation is) due to mutation/sexual reproduction;</p>
<p>c. valid example of variation in a specific population;</p>
<p>d. more offspring are produced than can survive / populations over-populate;</p>
<p>e. competition / struggle for resources/survival;</p>
<p>f. example of competition/struggle for resources;</p>
<p>g. survival of fittest/best adapted (to the changed environment)/those with beneficial adaptations / converse;</p>
<p>h. example of changed environment and adaptation to it;</p>
<p>i. favourable genes/alleles passed on / best adapted reproduce (more) /converse;</p>
<p>j. example of reproduction of individuals better adapted to changed environment;</p>
<p>k. alleles for adaptations to the changed environment increase in the population;</p>
<p>l. example of genes/alleles for adaptations increasing in a population;</p>
<p>m. evolution by natural selection;</p>
<p>n. evolution is (cumulative) change in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">population/species</span> over time / change in allele frequency;</p>
<p><em>Suitable examples are antibiotic resistance and the peppered moth but any genuine evidence-based example of adaptation to environmental change can be credited.</em></p>
