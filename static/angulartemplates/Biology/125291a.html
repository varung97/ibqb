<div class='question'>
<p>Neurotransmitter attaches to receptor site, initiating transmission</p>
<p>Nerve impulses are action potentials propagated along the axons of neurons</p>
<p>Resting potential is more negative inside/&ndash;70 mV/ more positive outside the membrane<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />a resting potential has greater concentration of Na ions outside than K ions inside the axon</p>
<p>&laquo;volted gated&raquo; channels open and Na ions diffuse in</p>
<p>Causes depolarization of the membrane/&ndash;70 mV to +40 mV</p>
<p>Local currents affect adjacent channels/cause action potential</p>
<p>Depolarization is followed by repolarization of the neuron&nbsp;</p>
<p>&laquo;voltage gated&raquo; channels open and K ions diffuse out/repolarize the membrane</p>
<p>Na-K pumps restore Na/K balance/resting potential</p>
<p>Myelin around the neuron insulates the axon<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />speeds the transmission</p>
<p>Myelin permits saltatory conduction<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />permits jumping from node to node</p>
<p><em>Award <strong>[6 max]</strong> if no mention of the role of myelin.</em></p>
