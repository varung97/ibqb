<div class='question'>
<p>What is the mechanism of sodium-potassium pumps in neurons that generates a resting potential by active transport?</p>
<p>A. K<sup>+</sup> from cytoplasm binds to the pump and stimulates its phosphorylation by ATP.<br />B. Phosphorylation of the pump causes its shape change in order to move Na<sup>+</sup> into the cytoplasm.<br />C. K<sup>+</sup> from inside the cell binds to the pump and causes the release of the phosphate group.<br />D. Na<sup>+</sup> from cytoplasm binds to the pump and stimulates its phosphorylation by ATP.</p>
