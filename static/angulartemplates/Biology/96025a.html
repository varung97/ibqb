<p>(for both groups) overall biomasses were higher during flowering than harvest / vice versa<br />the microbial biomass for the Bt crop was (slightly) lower than for the non-Bt crops at flower time;<br />the microbial biomass for the Bt crop was (slightly) higher than for the non-Bt crops at harvest time;</p>

<p>data does not support the hypothesis as there is little difference between biomass found in the soil (surrounding) roots (of the Bt and non-Bt) at either time;<br />data does not support the hypothesis as there is a slightly positive effect at harvest;<br />data supports hypothesis as there is a slightly negative effect at flowering;</p>
