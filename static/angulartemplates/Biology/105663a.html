<p>a. both increase with time;</p>
<p>b. normal mice have a greater increase in blood calcium levels than mutant mice (after ten minutes);</p>
<p>c. normal mice have a maximum change of 1.1 &mu;mol while mutant mice have a maximum change of 0.6 &mu;mol;</p>
<p>d. mutant mice show gradual increase while normal mice show rapid increase followed by a plateau;</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>b.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. mice with low calcium diets have a greater increase in blood calcium levels (after calcium administration) because their body absorbs more calcium;</p>
<p>b. if they have had a high calcium diet they do not need to absorb so much calcium / <em>vice versa</em>;</p>
<p>c. probably receptors are all occupied/inhibited / less receptors;</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>c.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. hypothesis supported as blood calcium levels increased in mutant mice after intake of calcium (graph A);</p>
<p>b. but less than in normal mice / perhaps not enough to cure disease/rickets;</p>
<p>c. administering vitamin D also shows an increase in blood calcium levels (graph A);</p>
<p>d. but no good administering vitamin D as the receptor is defective;</p>
<p>e. in a high calcium diet, less absorption occurs (graph B), so might not be the solution;</p>
<p>f. should have tested mutant mice with different diets;</p>
