<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">Inadequate filtering of waste products from the blood is known as kidney failure. If this condition is found in a patient, or albumin is present in their urine, it shows that the patient has chronic kidney disease. Type II diabetes is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease in Australia. The bar graph shows the frequency of kidney failure in patients with type II diabetes in different Australian ethnic groups. It also shows the level of albumin in the urine of patients with both type II diabetes and kidney failure.</p>

<p class="p1">The usual method of screening for chronic kidney disease is to test for kidney failure. Using the data in the bar chart, suggest why this method leads to more cases being missed in patients of indigenous Australian ancestry than in patients with European ancestry.</p>
