<p class="p1">Inadequate filtering of waste products from the blood is known as kidney failure. If this condition is found in a patient, or albumin is present in their urine, it shows that the patient has chronic kidney disease. Type II diabetes is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease in Australia. The bar graph shows the frequency of kidney failure in patients with type II diabetes in different Australian ethnic groups. It also shows the level of albumin in the urine of patients with both type II diabetes and kidney failure.</p>
