<div class='question'>
<p>eardrum/tympanic membrane vibrates with sound (waves);<br />movements of eardrum/tympanic membrane amplified by bones of middle ear/stapes;<br />bones are malleus/hammer, incus/anvil, stapes/stirrup;<br />movement transmitted to oval window;<br />creates pressure waves in the liquid within cochlea;<br />waves travel up to/dissipate at round window;<br />hairs in cochlea vibrate according to movement (of liquid/waves);<br />different frequencies detected by different hair cells (on different parts of membrane);<br />movement of hairs cause action potential/depolarization/hyperpolarization of hair cells;<br />cause nerve impulses to be transmitted through auditory nerve;</p>
