<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. organisms with similar gene sequence could be used as models for specific gene functions (in humans) </p>
<p>b. it is possible for researchers to learn about the gene function faster/more easily as fewer genes (in model) </p>
<p>c. can predict effects in other organisms </p>
<p>d. some research may be unethical in humans</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. results from BLASTn or BLASTp /genomic or proteomic sequences can be used </p>
<p>b. compared with data from available organisms </p>
<p>c. matches based on the number of similarities in the sequence are identified </p>
<p>d. similarities in sequence may be caused by evolution or by chance </p>
<p>e. computer programs (use sequence alignments) to suggest evolutionary relationships / cladograms can be constructed</p>
