<p>(i)</p>
<p>Boiling point of water is greater than methane</p>
<p>Melting point of water is greater than methane</p>
<p>Latent heat of vaporization of water is greater than methane<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />specific heat capacity of water is greater than methane</p>
<p>(ii)</p>
<p>Water is polar<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />O atom more negative<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />H atoms more positive</p>
<p>This causes &laquo;strong&raquo; hydrogen bonds to form <span style="text-decoration: underline;">between the molecules</span></p>
<p>Which require more/high amount of energy to break</p>
<p>Which increases the melting/boiling/latent heat properties</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>Short wave radiation/UV &laquo;shown as&raquo; having its origin in the Sun gives off light as short radiation</p>
<p>Short wave radiation/UV &laquo;shown as&raquo; passing through the greenhouse gases &laquo;some reflected&raquo;</p>
<p>Some short wave radiation/UV is absorbed by the Earth and some is reflected</p>
<p>The reflected radiation is long wave radiation &laquo;reflected as heat&raquo;</p>
<p>Long wave radiation/IR &laquo;shown as&raquo; being unable to pass through/being absorbed/reflected by the greenhouse gases</p>
<p><em>Award marks for diagrammatic explanations of these marking points</em>.<br /><em>Accept UV and IR as long as they are drawn with the correct wavelength</em>.</p>
