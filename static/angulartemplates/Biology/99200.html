<p>somatic cell therapy methods alter the genetic material of somatic cells/nongametes;<br />could cure the individual treated but disease can still be passed to offspring;<br />germ-line therapy methods alter the genetic material of sex-cells/gametes/sperm/eggs;<br />disease would be absent in future offspring;<br />retroviruses/viruses are used (as vectors);<br />to insert (normal) gene/allele (in host cells);<br />verified application, <em>e.g.</em> treatment of SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency);<br />no fully successful cases since relatively new / technical issues need to be solved <em>e.g.</em> ensure correct amount of gene product/at the right time/in the right place;<br />cases of gene therapy causing cancer in patients / infect healthy cells causing illness / harm other cell functions / <em>e.g.</em> (two) children treated for SCID developed leukaemia;<br />immune system may attack newly introduced viruses causing inflammation/toxicity/organ failure;</p>
