<div class='question'>
<p>a. used on genetic diseases caused by defective genes/lack of enzyme/ protein </p>
<p>b. viral vector (genetically) modified for (safe) use </p>
<p>c. virus genome is altered and missing gene/allele is introduced into virus </p>
<p>d. a retrovirus is used to introduce <span>RNA</span> and <span>reverse transcriptase</span> in a host cell </p>
<p>e. RNA is copied into DNA and introduced (permanently) into the cells genome </p>
<p>f. could use adenovirus/virus with DNA to introduce genetic material </p>
<p>g. in this technique DNA is not attached to cell genome </p>
<p>h. thus not replicated during host cell replication / treatment has to be repeated </p>
<p>i. it could be done in somatic treatment (body cells) or in sex cells (egg cells) </p>
<p>j. example (<em>ie</em> Gendicine, is an adenovirus used for treatment of head and neck cancer)</p>
