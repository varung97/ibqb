<p><em>Evidence that colour plays a role:</em><br>a. few yellow adults (relative to juveniles) means that yellow juveniles do not survive into adulthood </p>
<p>b. frequent brown adults (relative to juveniles) means brown juveniles survive well into adulthood </p>
<p><em>Evidence that colour does not play a role:</em><br>c. similar numbers of adult and juvenile pink individuals means pink colour does not play a role </p>
<p>d. all three colours show wide variation/considerable overlap therefore evidence is not strong </p>

<p>a. natural selection requires that snails become adults/live to reproduce their variations/undergo differential predation <em><strong>OWTTE</strong></em> </p>
<p>b. higher adult frequency of brown shows selection </p>
<p>c. but results for pink do not show selection </p>
<p>d. more brown juveniles survive into adulthood showing that brown is selected for/<em>vice versa</em> against yellow </p>
<p>e. not enough alone to support theory of natural selection but may be added evidence to similar observations in other organisms <em><strong>OWTTE</strong></em></p>
