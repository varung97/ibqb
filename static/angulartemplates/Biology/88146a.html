<p>a. warming results in melting (arctic/polar) ice (cap) / loss of ice habitats;<br />b. (warming) raises sea level / floods coastal areas / destroys coastal habitats;<br />c. (warming) of habitat would change species/flora/fauna that can be supported (named examples can be used);<br />d. decrease in size of population(s) / possible extinction of species;<br />e. temperate species move into area / arctic species adapt/move;<br />f. change in distribution of species/changes in migration patterns;<br />g. (ecological) changes will affect higher trophic levels/food webs/food chains;<br />h. increased rates of decomposition of detritus from (melting) permafrost;<br />i. increased success of pest species including pathogens;</p>

<p>a. (labelled) phospholipid consisting of head and two tails;<br />b. head is glycerol <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> phosphate;<br />c. tails are fatty acid chains;<br />d. head hydrophilic <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> tails hydrophobic;<br />e. hydrophilic molecules/heads attracted to/soluble in water;<br />f. hydrophobic molecules/tails not attracted to water but attracted to each other;<br />g. (properties of phospholipids leads to) formation of double layer in water;<br />h. stability in double layer because heads on outer edge are attracted to water and tails are attracted to each other in middle;<br />i. phospholipid bilayer in fluid/flexible state because of attraction of non-polar tails to each other;<br />j. (fluidity) allows membranes to change shape/vesicles to form or fuse with membrane/(fluidity) allows cells to divide;<br />k. non-polar amino acid side chains attracted to (hydrophobic) tails; <br /><em>Marks may be earned using suitable labelled/annotated diagrams illustrating the points given above.</em></p>
