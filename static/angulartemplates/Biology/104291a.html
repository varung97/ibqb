<p>(<em>circulation of blood through liver tissues &ndash; accept properly annotated diagram</em>)<br />hepatic artery brings oxygenated blood;<br />hepatic portal vein brings nutrients (from small intestine);<br />merge to form sinusoids where liver cells/hepatocytes store and regulate nutrients;<br />blood leaves through hepatic vein;</p>
<p>(<em>storage and regulation of nutrients</em>)</p>
<p>one named stored nutrient; (<em>e.g. carbohydrates/glycogen / iron / vitamin A/retinol / vitamin D/calciferol</em>)<br />(<em>award <strong>[1 max]</strong> for naming nutrients</em>)</p>
<p>hepatocytes regulate blood sugar level by storing glucose as glycogen / releasing glucose from breakdown of glycogen (facilitated by arrival from portal vein);<br />under influence of insulin/glucagon (respectively) (carried by hepatic artery);<br />blood lipids/cholesterol synthesized/broken down if required / secreted through bile;<br />iron stored from breakdown of hemoglobin/released when Po<sub>2</sub> is low;</p>
