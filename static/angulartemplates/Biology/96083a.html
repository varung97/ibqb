<p>antibiotic resistance can be inherited;<br />alleles for resistance can be passed from one cell to another by exchange of plasmids/conjugation;<br />some varieties are more resistant than others;<br />bacteria reproduce very rapidly and have high mutation rate;<br />evolution can occur rapidly;<br />increased exposure to antibiotics is the environmental change that selects for resistant varieties;<br />for example, in hospitals / animal feed / inappropriate prescriptions / not finishing prescriptions;<br />bacteria without resistance die / resistant bacteria survive and pass on genes to next generation;<br />results in change in genetic makeup of population;</p>

<p>immunity is the ability of an organism to resist infection;<br />due to presence of (specific) antibodies;<br />immunity can be active or passive;<br />passive due to receiving antibodies from external sources/across placenta/from breast milk/injection;<br />active results from facing an infection directly/through vaccination;<br />pathogen/foreign cell invades body;<br />leads to clonal selection/formation of B memory cells;<br />B-cells produce <span style="text-decoration: underline;">specific</span> antibodies;<br />if same pathogen enters body again memory cells activated/stimulated to divide;<br />antibodies produced faster <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> in greater amounts;</p>

<p><em>Benefits: <strong>[4 max]</strong></em><br />immunity results<br />can limit pandemics/epidemics/spread of (infectious) diseases;<br />diseases can be eradicated/smallpox eliminated;<br />reduces mortality/deaths due to disease;<br />can protect vulnerable groups/young/old/with other conditions;<br />decrease crippling effects of diseases (such as polio);<br />decreased health care costs;</p>
<p><em>Dangers: <strong>[4 max]</strong></em><br />may produce (mild) symptoms of the disease;<br />human error in preparation/storage/administration of vaccine;<br />individual may react badly to vaccine / defective immune system / hypersensitive/allergic reaction;<br />immunity may not be life-long/booster required;<br />possible toxic effects of mercury-based preservatives/thimerosal;</p>
