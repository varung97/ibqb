<div class='question'>
<p>photosynthesis rate increases as temperature rises (up to an optimum temperature);<br />(due to) increase in the rate of enzyme catalysed reactions/light independent reactions/the Calvin cycle;<br />(steep) drop in rate of photosynthesis above the optimum;<br />at high temperatures enzymes/Rubisco/RuBP carboxylase denature(s);<br />graph with correctly labelled axes showing relationship between temperature and rate of photosynthesis;<br />transpiration rate increases as temperature rises;<br />(energy/heat leads to more) to more evaporation of water (in the leaf);<br />faster diffusion of water <span style="text-decoration: underline;">vapour</span> at higher temperatures;<br />relative humidity falls as temperature rises / warmer air can hold more water vapour;<br />stomata may close at very high temperatures reducing the transpiration rate;<br />some plants open their stomata at very high temperatures to cool by transpiration;</p>
