<div class='question'>
<p class="p1">control of ADH secretion by negative feedback;</p>
<p class="p1">ADH controls water reabsorption in kidney;</p>
<p class="p1">osmoreceptors in hypothalamus monitor water content (in blood);</p>
<p class="p1">ADH produced by neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus;</p>
<p class="p1">transported (down axons of these cells) to the posterior pituitary;</p>
<p class="p1">low water content/high solute concentration <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in blood</span> ((usually) causes action potential to be sent to posterior pituitary);</p>
<p class="p1">posterior pituitary releases ADH which travels to collecting ducts of kidney;</p>
<p class="p1">more water reabsorbed (by collecting ducts) making water content (of blood) higher/solute concentration lower;</p>
<p class="p1">less ADH released;</p>
