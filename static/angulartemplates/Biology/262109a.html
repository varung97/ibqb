<p>a. «cell» respiration is the «controlled» release of energy from organic compounds to produce ATP <br><br>b. «cell respiration» involves the oxidation and reduction of electron carriers </p>
<p>c. in link reaction pyruvate is converted into acetyl coenzyme A, CO<sub>2</sub> is released and NAD is reduced </p>
<p>d. in the Krebs cycle, a 4 C molecule combines with acetyl CoA </p>
<p>e. <span>decarboxylation</span> releases 2 CO<sub>2</sub> molecules for each pyruvate / conversion of 6C to 5C/5C to 4C releases CO<sub>2</sub> </p>
<p>f. «3» reduced NAD and «1» reduced FAD are produced </p>
<p>g. ATP generated in the Krebs cycle </p>
<p>h. reduced molecules/FAD/NAD are carried to the cristae/inner membrane of the mitochondria </p>
<p>i. transfer of electrons between carriers in the electron transport chain in the membrane of the cristae is coupled to proton pumping </p>
<p>j. protons accumulate in intermembrane space/ between cristae/inner membrane and outer membrane<br><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br>proton / electrochemical gradient between intermembrane space and matrix is established </p>
<p>k. protons diffuse through ATP synthase to generate ATP </p>
<p>l. <span>chemiosmosis</span> is the use of a proton/electrochemical gradient to generate ATP </p>
<p>m. oxygen is the final electron acceptor</p>
<p><em>Accept any of the points in a correctly annotated diagram</em>.</p>

<p>a. ventilation is exchange of gases between lungs and air. </p>
<p>b. during inhalation diaphragm contracts <em><strong>AND</strong></em> lowers. </p>
<p><em>Both needed</em>.</p>
<p>c. external intercostal muscles contract, raising ribs upwards and outwards </p>
<p>d. increase in volume <em><strong>AND</strong></em> decrease in pressure within thoracic cavity </p>
<p>e. air drawn into alveoli bringing fresh supply of oxygen </p>
<p>f. oxygen concentration in alveolar sacs is higher than in blood capillaries </p>
<p>g. «oxygen concentration gradient» causes oxygen to diffuse out of alveoli into red blood cells in capillaries </p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. pyramid of energy has stepped shape with largest bottom step being producers, then first consumer, second consumer, <em>etc</em> <br><br>b. light energy «from sun» converted to chemical energy in carbon compounds by photosynthesis </p>
<p>c. energy released by respiration is used in living organisms <em><strong>AND</strong></em> converted to heat </p>
<p>d. heat «energy» is lost from ecosystems </p>
<p>e. approximately 10 % of energy in trophic level converted into new material for next level </p>
<p>f. energy also lost as undigested material/uneaten material/feces/excretion </p>
