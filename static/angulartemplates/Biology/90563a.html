<div class='question'>
<p>a. during diastole the heart muscles/atria/ventricles are relaxed;<br />b. blood enters the atria;<br />c. during atrial systole the atria contract and blood moves into the ventricles;<br />d. pressure (in ventricles) causes bicuspid/tricuspid/AV valves to close;<br />e. (this) closing of valves causes first heart sound;<br />f. during ventricular systole the ventricles contract causing blood to flow to aorta/pulmonary artery/arteries/out of heart;<br />g. semilunar valves close so blood does not return to the ventricles;<br />h. this causes the second heart sound;<br />i. blood leaving atria/ventricles during contraction is caused by increased pressure which reduces volume;</p>
