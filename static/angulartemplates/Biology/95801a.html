<p>polar amino acids are water soluble/hydrophilic, non-polar amino acids are not/hydrophobic;<br />distribution of amino acids influences the position of proteins (in membranes);<br />polar amino acids often found on outside of protein, non polar orientate themselves away from water/ in core of protein;<br />polar amino acids create hydrophilic channels through membranes;<br />non-polar amino acids interact with lipid bi-layer/stabilize proteins in membranes;<br />polarity of amino acids determines the specificity of active sites in enzymes;<br />polar and non-polar amino acids affect the tertiary and quaternary/3D structure of proteins;</p>
