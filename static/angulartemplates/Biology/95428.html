<p>absorption occurs through epithelial <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cells</span> on villi/tiny projections;<br />microvilli/brush border on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cell membrane</span> increase surface area;<br />tight junctions prevent leakage of nutrients;<br />lipids/fat soluble/non-polar substances diffuse across membranes;<br />converted into tryglicerides / coated with proteins to form chylomicrons/lipoproteins;<br />which enter into lacteals/lymphatic system by exocytosis;<br />fructose/hydrophilic food enters by facilitated diffusion/through channel proteins;<br />active transport requires ATP (from many mitochondria in cells) / against concentration gradient through pump proteins;<br /><em>e.g.</em> glucose/amino acids/minerals enter through co-transported sodium carriers;<br />endocytosis of large molecules (<em>e.g.</em> vitamin B12) / pinocytosis of liquids;<br />capillaries (close to epithelial cells) transport substances (to body via bloodstream);</p>
