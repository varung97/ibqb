<p>as volume of a cell increases, the ratio of its surface area to volume decreases;<br />food/oxygen enters through the surface of cells;<br />wastes leave through the surface of cells;<br />the rate of substance crossing the membrane depends on surface area;<br />more metabolic activity in a larger cell means more food and oxygen required;<br />large volume means longer diffusion time;<br />(large volume) means more wastes produced;<br />excess heat generated will not be lost efficiently (with low surface area to volume ratio);<br />eventually surface area can no longer serve the requirements of the cell;<br />this critical ratio stimulates <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mitosis</span>;<br />(thus) the size of the cell is reduced and kept within size limits;</p>
