<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='question'>
<p>Rhesus factor is an antigen present on the surface of red blood cells of Rhesus positive individuals. Rhesus positive (Rh<sup>+</sup> ) is dominant to Rhesus negative (Rh<sup>&ndash;</sup> ). A mother with Rhesus negative blood gives birth to a baby with Rhesus positive blood and there are concerns that subsequent pregnancies will trigger an immune response.</p>
<p>What is a possible explanation for why subsequent pregnancies could trigger an immune response?</p>
<p>A. Exposure to the Rh<sup>+</sup> antigen in the first pregnancy triggered the development of antibodies that could attack the blood of a future Rh<sup>+</sup> baby. <br />B. Exposure to the Rh<sup>+</sup> antigen in the first pregnancy triggered the development of specific phagocytes that could attack the blood of a future Rh<sup>+</sup> baby. <br />C. The mother has developed passive immunity to the Rh<sup>+</sup> factor. <br />D. The mother&rsquo;s immune system has been weakened by pregnancy.</p>
