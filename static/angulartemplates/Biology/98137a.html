<p>monosaccharides are single sugars <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> disaccharides are two sugars <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> polysaccharides are multiple sugars;<br />hydrolysis is the addition of water to split a molecule into smaller fragments;<br />&ndash;OH and &ndash;H are added to the fragments;<br />disaccharides are split/digested into two single sugars;<br />polysaccharides are broken/digested into smaller fragments (<em>e.g.</em> diasaccharides);<br />process depends on enzyme control (in organisms);</p>

<p>a particular yeast (growing in natural milk) contains lactase;<br /> biotechnology companies can grow/culture the yeast;<br />lactase (an enzyme) is extracted from the yeast;<br />natural milk contains lactose/milk sugar;<br />when added directly to milk, lactase converts lactose into simpler forms;<br />same effect when milk is passed past immobilized (on surface or beads) lactase;<br />simpler forms of sugar (glucose and galactose) are easily absorbed (in the small intestine);<br />a commercial market exists for lactose-free milk / lactose-free milk is example of biotechnology&rsquo;s economic impact;<br />some people are lactose intolerant/cannot digest lactose in milk/have lost lactase activity in intestinal cells;<br />consuming lactose-free milk allows lactose intolerant people to be nourished by milk without discomfort (abdominal cramps and diarrhoea);<br />many Asians are lactose intolerant whereas less common among other groups (northern Europeans and some Africans);<br />biotechnology produced in one part of world is more useful in another;</p>

<p>food must be in a small enough form to leave the gut and enter the bloodstream;<br />physical breakdown is not enough / chemical breakdown is necessary;<br />enzymes are required for the chemical breakdown of food;<br />enzymes increase the rate of digestion;<br />enzymes are biological catalysts;<br />enzymes allow digestion to occur at body temperature;<br />enzymatic digestion is a sequential process <em>e.g.</em> from protein to peptide to amino acid;<br />specific location for each reaction with specific conditions/environments <em>e.g.</em> stomach high acidity;<br />most enzymes work extracellularly / some enzymes work intracellularly;<br />variations in pH throughout digestive tract promote the activity of different digestive enzymes / different enzymes have different optimal pHs;<br />amylases digest carbohydrate to monosaccharides;<br />proteases digest proteins to amino acids;<br />lipases digest fats to fatty acids and glycerol;</p>
