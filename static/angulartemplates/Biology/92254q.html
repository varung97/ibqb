<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">A study was conducted into the influence of genetic factors on occasional cocaine use, abuse and dependency. Pairs of female twins were interviewed to determine if either or both of them had used cocaine at all and also whether they had become abusers of cocaine or dependent upon it. Abuse was diagnosed if cocaine was having harmful consequences on the life of the person and dependence by signs that the person would suffer withdrawal symptoms without it. For each of these three stages of cocaine use, concordance rates were calculated for both identical and non-identical twins. The concordance rate is how many pairs of twins are both at a particular stage, expressed as a percentage of the total number of pairs in which either or both are at that stage. The bar chart shows the results.</p>
