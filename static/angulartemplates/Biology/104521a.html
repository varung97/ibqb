<p>tertiary is the specific 3D structure (determined by the primary structure);<br />giving rise to the specific shape of the active site;<br />(tertiary structure) enables enzymes to bind (effectively) to substrate;<br />determines whether some enzymes have broad or narrow specificity;<br />inhibitors/cofactors can affect tertiary structure and therefore function;</p>

<p>inhibitor is the product of the last reaction in a metabolic pathway;<br />inhibits the enzyme that catalyses the first reaction;<br />prevents build up of unnecessary product/only produced when needed;<br />the inhibitor binds (reversibly) to the allosteric site (different from active site);<br />this alters the shape of active site (so substrate will not fit); <br /><em>To award <strong>[3]</strong> answers must mention allosteric sites</em>.</p>
