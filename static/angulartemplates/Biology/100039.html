<p>varied members of a single species occupy a variety of niches / migration of a species to an area with a variety of niches;<br />natural selection/selection pressure will be different in various niches causing adaptation of groups to the varied niches;<br />results in many species from one ancestral species;<br />reproductive isolation enhances adaptive radiation;<br />adaptive radiation results in speciation;</p>

<p>in gradualism evolution occurs at a constant pace;<br />fossil records of gradual change with intermediate forms support this theory;<br />evolution of modern horse/another suitable example seems to support this view;<br />in punctuated equilibrium evolution proceeds rapidly for short periods of time intermittent with long periods of little change/stability;<br />gaps in the fossil record/lack of intermediate forms support the idea of punctuated equilibrium;<br />strata in the fossil record with appearance of many new species following a mass extinction supports the idea of punctuated equilibrium;</p>
