<div class='question'>
<p>a. &laquo;in biofilms&raquo; bacteria exhibit &laquo;emergent&raquo; properties not predictable from the individual components of the system<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />biofilm exhibits its own properties, quite different in comparison with those shown by the single species&nbsp;<br /><br />b. biofilms form when bacteria adhere to surface of tooth and begin to excrete an EPS/extracellular polymeric substances/exopolysaccharides&nbsp;</p>
<p>c. formation of EPS maintains bacteria together &laquo;in biofilm&raquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>d. interspecies relationships are favourable<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />one species produces growth factors for/facilitates attachment of another species&nbsp;</p>
<p>e. individual forces are low but the overall binding force can exceed that of covalent bonds&nbsp;</p>
<p>f. glue properties/cohesiveness given by different types of bonding&nbsp;</p>
<p>g. biofilms show resistance to antibiotics/other pathogen</p>
