<div class='question'>
<p>during exercise the rate of tissue respiration increases/more carbon dioxide produced;</p>
<p>carbon dioxide production in the tissues exceeds the rate of breathing it out;</p>
<p>increase in carbonic acid / increase in H\(^ + \) ions / pH drops in the blood plasma;</p>
<p>lactic acid (in strenuous exercise) reduces pH;</p>
<p>chemoreceptors/chemosensors detect change in pH/increase in carbon dioxide/ decrease in oxygen;</p>
<p>receptors in the carotid/aortic bodies;</p>
<p>nerve impulses sent to the breathing centres of the brain;</p>
<p>nerve impulses then sent to diaphragm/intercostal muscles;</p>
<p>negative feedback control;</p>
