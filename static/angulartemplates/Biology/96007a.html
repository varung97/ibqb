<p>polar and non-polar amino acids help determine protein structure;<br />polar amino acids on the outside of proteins make them soluble in water;<br />polar amino acids in channels in membranes allow passage of polar substances/ reference to surface proteins or membranes;<br />polarity <em><strong>or</strong></em> non-polarity of surface amino acids on proteins determines their interaction with other molecules (substrates, hormones, signalling molecules);</p>

<p>inhibitor molecule attaches to enzyme at site away from active site/attaches to allosteric site;<br />binding of inhibitor molecule alters shape of active site/causes conformational change;<br />shape change in active site disables enzyme from accepting substrate/reduces enzyme activity/destroys enzyme functionality;<br />increasing substrate concentration has no effect on the inhibitor;<br />irreversible;</p>
