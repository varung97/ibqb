<div class='question_part_label'>a.i.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. to identify species/pathogenic organisms<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />successful uptake of DNA in genetically modified organisms/GMOs&nbsp;</p>
<p>b. to detect disease due to variation in DNA &laquo;substitution/deletion&raquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>c. to determine risk of developing certain disorders&nbsp;</p>
<p>d. to confer resistance to antibiotic/agent that would normally kill it&nbsp;</p>
<p>e. to make cells containing gene look different<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />green fluorescent tag makes cells visible under UV light</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>a.ii.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. gene therapy trials have used viruses to deliver un-mutated copies of genes to the &laquo;somatic&raquo; cells of the patient's body&nbsp;</p>
<p>b. examples of the use of viral vectors &nbsp;<em>eg gene therapy may provide a way to cure genetic disorders, such as severe combined immunodeficiency</em></p>
<p>c. one of the main problems is immune response to viruses / may cause toxicity/disease&nbsp;</p>
<p>d. some viral vectors insert their genomes at a random location on one of the host chromosomes &laquo;which can disturb the function of cellular gene&raquo; / enter wrong cells &laquo;if targeting tumour&raquo; / could lead to cancer</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>b.</div>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. analyze tissue/blood sample for DNA sequence&nbsp;</p>
<p>b. each spot &laquo;on microarray&raquo; has small quantity of specific DNA sequence/probe&nbsp;</p>
<p>c. reverse transcriptase used to make cDNA&nbsp;</p>
<p>d. fluorescent dye linked to cDNA&nbsp;</p>
<p>e. &laquo;cDNA&raquo; binds to/hybridizes with probes that have complementary base sequences&nbsp;</p>
<p>f. fluorescence/different colours shows probes have hybridized / which sequences were in the tissue sample</p>
<p><em>Allow specific examples of genetic diseases</em>.</p>
