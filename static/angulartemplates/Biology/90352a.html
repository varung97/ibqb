<p>type 1 caused by destruction of insulin secreting cells/beta cells (in pancreas) / insufficient insulin produced / genetic disorder resulting in failure to produce insulin;</p>
<p>type II caused by decreased response of body cells/receptors to insulin (that is produced);</p>
<p>type I early onset while type II adult onset;</p>
<p>type I treated with insulin while type II with diet (lifestyle changes);</p>

<p>yes, effect is reversible as activity returns to (approximately) original level (when lipids/fatty acids decrease);</p>
<p>when lipid/fatty acids washed out enzyme is more active/activity increases;</p>
<p>difference between starting and final levels of enzyme activity is insignificant because of error bars;</p>
<p>three hours/experimental time may be insufficient to reverse the effect</p>

<p>increased insulin concentration causes more glucose absorption (up to 10<sup>3</sup> &mu;U ml<sup>&ndash;1</sup>);</p>
<p>glucose absorption in muscle bathed in lipid always less than control;</p>
<p>no further increase/slight decrease in glucose absorption beyond 103 (&mu;U ml<sup>&ndash;1</sup>) insulin;</p>

<p><em>Referring to first graph</em>:<br />plasma lipids lower activity of enzyme (needed for glucose absorption);</p>
<p><br /><em>Referring to second graph</em>:<br />more/higher glucose uptake with higher insulin levels in muscles without lipids (compared to muscles bathed in lipids);<br />lipids reduce glucose absorption (even at raised insulin concentrations);<br />isolated muscle used in experiments so results may differ in whole organisms;</p>
