<p class="p1">The cholesterol-lowering effect of <em>Lactobacillus </em>bacteria was studied. Forty rats were divided into groups and fed either a normal or high cholesterol diet. Some rats fed the high cholesterol diet were also supplemented with <em>L. fermentum </em>or <em>L. plantarum</em>. After a six week feeding period, the concentration of cholesterol in liver tissue and the mass of bile salts in feces were measured.</p>
