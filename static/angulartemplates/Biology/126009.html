<div class='question'>
<p>Infected individual will have pathogens/antigens in bodily fluids</p>
<p>Test contains immobilized/fixed antibodies to the pathogen/antigen</p>
<p>If present, antigen binds to &laquo;immobilized&raquo; antibody/capture molecule</p>
<p>Solution is washed and only fixed antigen-antibody complexes persist</p>
<p>Then a detection antibody linked to an enzyme is added</p>
<p>Reacts with fixed antigen-antibody complex</p>
<p>A chromogenic/potentially fluorescent substance is added</p>
<p>Enzyme changes substance to a different/detectable colour</p>
<p>The presence of colour is a positive response/absence of colour a negative response</p>
