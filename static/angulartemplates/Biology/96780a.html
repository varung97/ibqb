<p>there was a decrease in damage by all three types of stem borers compared to control;<br />there was almost no change in damage by <em>Eldana</em> compared to control;<br />there was almost no damage/little effect (to Bt maize type A) by <em>Sesamia</em> (and <em>Eldana</em>);<br /><em>Busseola</em> caused the most damage (to Bt maize type A);</p>

<p>very efficient at controlling <em>Sesamia</em>;<br />type B is the most effective against the three stem borers collectively;<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span> type of Bt maize controlled <em>Busseola</em> well / vice versa i.e. <em>Busseola</em> not well controlled by any types of Bt maize;<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> types of Bt maize decreased <em>Sesamia</em> damage (significantly) / Bt maize type E not damaged by <em>Sesamia</em> / vice versa;<br />Bt maize types C/H/I had more damage caused by <em>Busseola</em> (than was caused in the control) / vice versa;<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> types of Bt maize decreased <em>Eldana</em> damage (to some extent) / type B was not damaged by <em>Eldana</em> / vice versa;<br /><em>Eldana</em> damage low in control / less effect;<br />cannot determine efficiency since data is about leaf damage and stem borers may feed (preferentially) on other structures/stems/roots;</p>

<p>mass increases in all three groups;<br />increase is more rapid in beginning and tapers off later in the study;<br />mass seems to be levelling off in rats fed Bt and non-Bt maize / rate of increase in mass is slowing down;<br />rats fed rat food always have higher mass/greater mass increase than those fed either type of maize;</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>all three foods result in the same pattern of growth/mass gain / highest rate of growth at start of study / tapering off later in the study;<br />Bt maize causes same amount of growth as non-Bt maize / appears to be as good a food source as non-Bt maize / there is no significant difference between Bt and non-Bt maize (in terms of mass gain);<br />corn (both types) appears to cause less growth/mass gain than rat food / vice versa;<br />genetic modification does not affect growth/mass gain;<br />no evidence to support risk of Bt maize to growth/mass gain;<br />study does not investigate other possible risks of Bt maize to rats;<br />sample size is small / only 12 rats (in each group) so this may not be enough to give trends;<br />only female rats tested, no males;</p>
