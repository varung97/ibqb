<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. early evidence showed membranes are partially permeable <em><strong>AND</strong></em> organic solvents penetrate faster than water </p>
<p>b. suggests they have non-polar regions </p>
<p>c. chemical analysis showed membranes consist mainly of proteins and lipids </p>
<p>d. layer of phospholipids spread over water, orientate themselves into monolayer with nonpolar/hydrophobic tails out of water and polar/hydrophilic heads in water surface </p>
<p>e. when shaken with water form micelles/particles with tails inwards away from water </p>
<p>f. Davson–Danielli model proposed phospholipid bilayer coated with protein molecules on both surfaces </p>
<p>g. evidence from electron microscopy «supported Davson–Danielli model» </p>
<p>h. three-layered structure/ sandwich/railway tracks/two dark bands with a light band between </p>
<p>i. model could not account for hydrophobic proteins / artifacts due to low resolution </p>
<p>j. fluorescent labelling / freeze fracturing later used to investigate membrane structure </p>
<p>k. led to Singer-Nicholson / fluid mosaic model of protein molecules floating in fluid lipid bilayer </p>
<p>l. shows particles/proteins project partially and sometimes right through lipid bilayer </p>
<p>m. indicates <span>peripheral</span> and <span>integral</span> proteins present</p>

<p>a. active transport/loading of sucrose/amino acids/organic metabolites </p>
<p>b. sucrose moves by apoplastic / symplastic routes </p>
<p>c. «loading» at source into <span>companion cells</span> «of sieve tubes» </p>
<p>d. movement «of sucrose» through plasmodesmata </p>
<p>e. high concentration of solutes in phloem leads to water movement by osmosis</p>
