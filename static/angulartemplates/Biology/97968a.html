<p>atria collect blood from veins (vena cava/pulmonary);<br />collect blood while ventricles are contracting;<br />atria pump blood into ventricles/ensure ventricles are full;<br />ventricles pump blood into arteries/out of the heart;<br />ventricles pump blood at high pressure because of their thicker, muscular walls;<br />mention of heart valves working with atria and ventricles to keep blood moving;<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">left ventricle</span> pumps blood to systems and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">right ventricle</span> pumps blood to lungs;</p>
<p><em>Both left and right ventricles with correct function required for mark to be awarded.</em></p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>thick wall to withstand high blood pressures/avoid bursting/leaks;<br />many muscle fibres to help pump blood;<br />many elastic fibres to stretch and pump blood after each heart beat;<br />narrow lumen to maintain high pressure/because blood flows along rapidly;<br />thick outer layer of collagen to give strength/prevent aneurism;<br />no valves as pressure is high enough to prevent backflow;<br />endothelium/smooth inner lining to reduce friction;</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>one gene determines (ABO) blood groups / one gene for ABO blood groups;<br />genes have different/alternative forms called alleles;<br />there are three alleles (I<sup>A</sup>, I<sup>B</sup> and i) of the gene for (ABO) blood groups;<br />(ABO) blood groups are an example (of the effect of) multiple alleles (in this instance three alleles can result in four phenotypes);<br />each individual has two alleles of the gene but only one is passed to offspring;<br />alleles that are codominant both affect the phenotype in a heterozygote;<br />(alleles) I<sup>A</sup> and I<sup>B</sup> are codominant;<br />(alleles) I<sup>A</sup> and I<sup>B</sup> are dominant over i / i is recessive to I<sup>A</sup> and I<sup>B</sup>;<br />(genotypes) I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>A</sup> and I<sup>A</sup>i both give blood group A;<br />(genotypes) I<sup>B</sup>I<sup>B</sup> and I<sup>B</sup>i both give blood group B;<br />(genotype) I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>B</sup> gives blood group AB;<br />(genotype) ii/homozygous <span style="text-decoration: underline;">i</span> gives blood group O;<br />example of a cross involving ABO blood groups;</p>
