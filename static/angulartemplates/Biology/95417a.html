<div class='question'>
<p><em>indicator species:<br /></em>indicator species are sensitive to/need specific environmental conditions/have specific/limited range of tolerance;<br />their population growth/disappearance/reduction indicates specific changes in the environment;<br />example of indicator species <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> what it indicates; (<em>e.g. decrease in the population of stonefly larvae indicates increasing pollution levels/dissolved oxygen loss</em>)<br /><em>Allow any other example.</em></p>
<p><em>biotic index:</em><br />compares the relative frequency of indicator species;<br />can be calculated for overall environmental assessment of an ecosystem;<br />multiply number of individuals of each indicator species by its pollution tolerance rating;<br />an abundance of intolerant species gives a high score / <em>vice versa</em>;<br />indicating an unpolluted environment / <em>vice versa</em>;<br />a change in the biotic index over time indicates a change in environmental conditions; <br /><em>Award <strong>[4 max]</strong> if only indicator species or biotic indices are addressed.</em></p>
