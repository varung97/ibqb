<p><strong>NB</strong>: <em>Drawings must be correctly proportioned and clearly drawn showing </em><em>connections between structures.

<p>a. (both) atria collect blood (from veins);<br />b. sinoatrial/SA node sends impulses to muscle/fibres initiating contraction;<br />c. blood is pushed to ventricles by contraction of atria/atrial systole;<br />d. AV (atrioventricular) valves are open (as atria contract);<br />e. semilunar valves are closed so that ventricles fill with blood;<br />f. ventricles contract / ventricular systole;<br />g. AV (atrioventricular) valves close (and preventing backflow);<br />h. blood is pushed out through the semilunar valves/into pulmonary artery and aorta;<br />i. when ventricles relax/diastole, semilunar valves close preventing backflow of blood; <br /><em>Do not accept the description of blood flow without a clear action.</em><br /><em>Do not accept general statements such as systole = heart contraction and </em><em>diastole = heart relaxation.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>[4 max]</strong> if suggests that left and right sides are contracting at different times or </em><em>simultaneous contraction not indicated.</em><br /><br /></p>

<p>a. nerve impulse reaches the end of the presynaptic neuron;<br />b. (depolarization causes) calcium channels in membrane (to) open;<br />c. calcium diffuses into the presynaptic neuron;<br />d. vesicles of/containing neurotransmitter move to and fuse with presynaptic membrane;<br />e. (neurotransmitter) released (by exocytosis) into synaptic space/cleft;<br />f. (neurotransmitter) diffuses across the space/synapse;<br />g. (neurotransmitter) attaches to receptors on postsynaptic neuron;<br />h. receptors cause ion channels to open and sodium diffuses into the postsynaptic neuron;<br />i. the postsynaptic neuron membrane is depolarized;<br />j. (depolarization) causes a new action potential;<br />k. (neurotransmitter) on postsynaptic membrane is broken down;<br />l. (neurotransmitter) is reabsorbed into the presynaptic neuron;</p>
