<div class='question'>
<p>a. exponential growth occurs in ideal/unlimited environment&nbsp;</p>
<p>b. population growth determined by natality, mortality, immigration and emigration&nbsp;</p>
<p>c. natality / births / reproduction increases population<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />number of reproducing individuals determine the rate of growth&nbsp;</p>
<p>d. as long as natality is higher than mortality&nbsp;</p>
<p>e. low mortality leads to exponential growth&nbsp;</p>
<p>f. absence of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">limiting factors</span> will lead to exponential growth&nbsp;</p>
<p>g. &laquo;limiting factors&raquo; could be &laquo;competition for&raquo; resources/habitat / presence of predators/diseases&nbsp;</p>
<p>h. higher mortality and/or emigration compared to natality and/or immigration cause population to decrease/rate of growth to slow&nbsp;</p>
<p>i. graph with exponential curve/exponential part of sigmoid curve labelled</p>
