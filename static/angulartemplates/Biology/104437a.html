<p>condensation is joining together molecules with the release of water;<br />(in general) two monosaccharides join to form a disaccharide / many mono-saccharides/disaccharides form polysaccharides;<br />example; (<em>eg. two glucose from maltose</em>)<br />hydrolysis is the breaking down of molecules with the addition of water;<br />(in general) disaccharides break into monosaccharides / polysaccharides break into disaccharides/monosaccharides;<br />example; (<em>eg. maltose forms two glucose</em>)</p>

<p>enzymes speed up the rate of chemical reactions;<br />lock and key model;<br />substrate fits into active site;<br />enzyme-substrate specificity;<br />enzymes work best at optimal pH/different enzymes have different optimal pHs;<br />increase/decrease from optimum pH decreases activity;<br />change in pH changes structure/charge of active site;<br />changing three-dimensional structure of enzyme/protein;<br />not allowing substrate to fit in active site;<br />enzymes can be denatured if change is extreme;<br />denaturing is loss of its biological properties;<br />sketch graph showing pH versus enzyme activity;</p>

<p>chewing food makes smaller particles/increases surface area of food;<br />starch digestion (begins) in the mouth/by saliva/(salivary) amylase/ptyalin;<br />digestion of proteins in stomach;<br />acid condition in stomach provides optimum pH for enzymes;<br />stomach muscle contraction causes mechanical digestion;<br />enzymes in small intestine complete digestion;<br />alkaline condition in small intestine provides optimum pH for enzymes;<br />bile salts help to emulsify fats;<br />example of amylase with source, substrate and products;<br />example of protease with source, substrate and products;<br />example of lipase with source, substrate and products;</p>
