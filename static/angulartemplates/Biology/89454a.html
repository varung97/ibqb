<p><em> Award <strong>[1]</strong> for each of the following structures clearly drawn and labelled correctly in a diagram of the heart.</em></p>
<p>a. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">left ventricle/right ventricle</span> &ndash; both left and right ventricles must be shown but the mark can be awarded if either is correctly labelled. The left must be thicker walled than right and both must be larger than the atria;</p>
<p>b. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">left atrium/right atrium</span> &ndash; both left and right atria must be shown with thinner walls than ventricles, but the mark can be awarded if either atrium is correctly labelled;</p>
<p>c. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">atrio-ventricular valves/tricuspid</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bicuspid</span> valves &ndash; positioned between atria and ventricles, with both labelled and tri/bicuspid correct if these names are used;</p>
<p>d. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">semi-lunar valves</span> &ndash;shown at the start of the aorta and pulmonary artery, with the cusps facing in the right direction;</p>
<p><em>Award <strong>[1]</strong> for any two blood vessels clearly drawn and correctly labelled.</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">aorta</span> &ndash; shown connected to the left ventricle;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">pulmonary artery</span> &ndash; shown connected to the right ventricle;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">pulmonary vein</span> &ndash; shown connected to the left atrium;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">vena cava</span> &ndash; shown connected to the right atrium;</p>

<p>a. (high blood glucose levels) detected by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pancreas islet cells</span>/<span style="text-decoration: underline;">beta cells</span>;</p>
<p>b. insulin secreted in response (to high blood glucose/glucose above threshold level);</p>
<p>c. insulin stimulates cells to absorb glucose;</p>
<p>d. glucose used in cell respiration (rather than lipids);</p>
<p>e. glucose converted to glycogen (in liver/muscle cells);</p>
<p>f. glucose converted to fatty acids/triglycerides/fat;</p>
<p>g. negative feedback process;</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. ultrafiltration in the glomerulus produces (large volumes of) filtrate;</p>
<p>b. 80%/most of water in filtrate is (always) (re)absorbed in proximal convoluted tubule;</p>
<p>c. water reabsorbed from filtrate in descending loop of Henle;</p>
<p>d. pituitary gland secretes ADH if blood solute concentration is too high;</p>
<p>e. ADH makes the collecting duct/distal convoluted tubule more permeable to water;</p>
<p>f. ADH moves aquaporins into the membranes (of cells in the tubule wall);</p>
<p>g. more water reabsorbed from filtrate/into blood due to ADH;</p>
<p>h. blood becomes more dilute / small volume of urine with high solute concentration;</p>
<p>i. with low/no ADH less water is reabsorbed in the collecting duct;</p>
<p>j. blood becomes more concentrated / large volume of dilute urine;</p>
<p>k. water reabsorption in collecting duct due to high solute concentration of medulla;</p>
<p>l. active transport of Na<sup>+ </sup>ions from filtrate in ascending limb of loop of Henle;</p>
