<p>a. share 17 (out of 29) amino acids in common / more amino acids similar than different;</p>
<p>b. both have Mn in the enzyme (as cofactor);</p>
<p>c. greatest difference between them is from amino acid 18 to 22;</p>
<p>d. mitochondrial has Gly (position 12) while <em>E. coli</em> (Mn) never has Gly;</p>
<p>e. Leu is most common amino acid in both appearing four times / other valid comparison;</p>
