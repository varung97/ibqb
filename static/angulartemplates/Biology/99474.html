<div class='question'>
<p>metabolic pathway is a series of reactions carried out in a particular sequence;<br />products of one reaction become substrates for the next;<br />each reaction is enzyme-catalyzed (and thus represents point of control);<br />some enzymes are allosteric;<br />allosteric control / end-product inhibition/negative feedback;<br />end-product acts as inhibitor of enzyme at beginning of pathway;<br />product binding changes the conformation of the active site so substrate of the pathway can no longer bind;</p>
