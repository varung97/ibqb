<p>cohesive properties help in transpiration pull/movement of water in plants;<br />high surface tension allows some animals to stride across its surface;<br />high latent heat of evaporation/large amounts of energy required for evaporation makes it a good coolant;<br />high specific heat capacity causes it to maintain environmental temperatures;<br />low density as ice forms insulation of lakes allowing life below;<br />transparency for photosynthesis;<br />transparency for vision in animals;<br />solvent properties make it the medium for metabolic reactions;<br />solvent properties allow transport of (soluble) molecules/food;</p>

<p>osmoregulation is control of water balance in organisms/blood/tissues/ cytoplasm;<br />ADH regulates water levels/solute concentration of the blood;<br />produced/released when water in blood is too low;<br />it increases the permeability of the collecting ducts / increase in the reabsorption of water;<br />leads to more aquaporins (in collecting duct cell membranes);<br />lower volume/less urine is produced/urine more concentrated;</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>water enters roots through the root hairs by osmosis;<br />root hairs provide an extended surface area (for active transport and osmosis);<br />active transport of ions from soil into the roots (enhances osmotic pressure);<br />osmotic pressure moves water into the xylem;<br />water is carried (in a transpiration stream) in the xylem;<br />adhesion of water to the inside of the xylem helps move water up;<br />cohesion of water to itself enhances water movement up the xylem;<br />water diffuses into air spaces (in spongy mesophyll) of leaves;<br />it passes out through the stomata by evaporation/transpiration;<br />evaporation sets up a transpiration pull that keeps the water moving;<br />guard cells control the rate of transpiration pull/evaporation;<br />xylem vessels are tubes with helical rings to enhance water movement/resist low pressure;</p>
