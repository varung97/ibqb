<p>a. pyramid of energy shows the flow of energy from one trophic level to the next (in a community);<br />b. units of pyramids of energy are energy per unit area per unit time/kJ m<sup>&ndash;2</sup> yr <sup>&ndash;1</sup>;<br />c. bar width is proportional to the energy stored (in the biomass) in that trophic level;<br />d. the first/lowest trophic level is producers;<br />e. second level is primary consumers/herbivores;<br />f. third level of secondary consumers/carnivores;<br />g. only a small amount (10 to 20 %) of energy of one level is passed to the next;<br />h. bar width/energy stored in the trophic level decreases (proportionally) as you go up each level;<br />i. pyramid shows that there is a limit to the length of food chains; <br /><em>Award any of the above marking points to a correctly drawn and clearly labelled pyramid.</em></p>

<p>a. normal body core temperature constant/36.5 to 37.5&deg;C; (<em>accept single values within this range</em>)<br />b. regulated by negative feedback/homeostatic mechanisms;<br />c. hypothalamus is the centre of thermoregulation;<br />d. hypothalamus sends impulses to the body to increase/decrease temperatures;<br />e. release of sweat (by sweat glands in the skin) if skin temperature rises;<br />f. evaporation of water cools the body; (<em>concept of evaporation must be mentioned</em>)<br />g. heat is transferred by blood;<br />h. transfer of heat from body core in blood to surface;<br />i. if temperature rises, increased flow of blood/heat to the skin/vasodilation of skin blood vessels/arterioles; (<em>do not accept veins, arteries or capillaries</em>)<br />j. if temperature drops, decreased flow of blood/heat to the skin/vasoconstriction of skin blood vessels/arterioles; (<em>do not accept</em><br /><em>veins, arteries&nbsp; or capillaries</em>)<br />k. shivering increases heat production (in muscles);<br />l. example of one behavioural mechanism; <em>(eg reducing activity (to lower body temperature) / reducing exposed surfaces (to reduce heat loss)</em></p>
