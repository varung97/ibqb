<p>a. without alcohol (antennation starts at a high level and) decreases with time;<br />b. with alcohol, the value (starts low and) very slowly increases;<br />c. the values of both groups become very similar with time;</p>

<p>a. (time spent) walking is greater in bees without alcohol (than alcohol);<br />b. (time spent) grooming is greater with alcohol (than without alcohol);<br />c. the end point difference is greater in walking;<br />d. (time spent) walking increases whereas grooming decreases for both groups of bees;</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. (hypothesis is supported as) alcohol decreases antennation at the start of the experiment;<br />b. (hypothesis is supported as) alcohol increases begging at the start;<br />c. begging time is more variable/less significant differences with alcohol (so less clear than in antennation);<br />d. (hypothesis is supported as) the effect of alcohol on social behaviors becomes less distinguishable over time (with the effect of sucrose) / OWTTE;</p>
