<p>gradualism is the slow change from one form to another;<br />requires long periods of time with relatively constant rate of change;<br />with punctuated equilibrium short periods of rapid evolution occur followed by long periods without change;<br />punctuated equilibrium fits with sudden environmental change/violent environmental conditions/volcanic eruptions/meteor impact;<br />in punctuated equilibrium, adaptations needed to cope with new environmental conditions/directional selection;<br />fossil record does not support gradualism / mass extinctions support punctuated equilibrium;<br />if no change in environment, then natural selection would oppose changes in gene pool;</p>
