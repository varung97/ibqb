<p>a. hemophilia is due to a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">recessive allele</span>/is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">recessive</span> trait / X<sup>H</sup> is normal allele and X<sup>h</sup> is hemophilia allele;<br />b. hemophilia is sex linked;<br />c. allele/gene is on the X chromosome;<br /><em>Reject disease/hemophilia carried on X chromosome.</em><br />d. (sex chromosomes in) females are XX while males are XY;</p>
<p>e. Y chromosomes do not have the allele/hemophiliac males are X<sup>h</sup>Y;<br />f. males inherit their X chromosome from their mother/do not pass the allele to sons;<br />g. males have only one copy so recessive trait/allele is not masked;<br />h. males have a 50% chance of hemophilia/receiving the allele if mother is a carrier;</p>
<p>i. carrier is heterozygous for the gene/is X<sup>H</sup>X<sup>h</sup>;<br />j. dominant/normal allele masks the recessive allele (so clotting is normal);<br />k. females inherit one X chromosome from father and one from mother;<br />l. affected/hemophiliac males have carrier daughters;<br />m. hemophilia allele could have been inherited from either parent;</p>
