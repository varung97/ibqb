<p>CXCL12 inhibition initially decreases occurrence of diabetes;<br />in the first 25 / up to 26/27/28 weeks;<br />CXCL12 inhibition does not prevent occurrence of diabetes (just delays it) / eventually the same level of diabetes</p>
<div class='question_part_label'> f (i).</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>CXCL12 breakdown allows stem cell mobilization reducing incidence of diabetes / stem cells from the bone marrow can regenerate the islets (in pancreas)</p>
<div class='question_part_label'> f (ii).</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>isoprenaline is an inhibitor of CXCL12 / inhibits synthesis of CXCL12 mRNA;<br />delays onset of diabetes / allows stem cell mobilization / allows islet regeneration;<br />does not cure the disease;</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>suffering of patients could be reduced / diseases could be cured / better treatments developed / might replace treatment with cure;<br />(possibly) less cost than treating disease/diabetes;<br />specific example of ethical conflict; (<em>e.g. patient groups support use of embryotic stem cells but religious groups oppose / different views on the moral status of an embryo</em>)<br />restrictions on research in some countries due to cultural/religious traditions;<br />still in experimental stages / risk to patient;<br />specific example of risk; (<em>e.g. stem cells developing into tumours / rejection / need for immunosuppressants</em>)<br />death of early-stage embryos / production of embryos for stem cell research;<br />use of stem cells from adults/patients could overcome these objections;</p>

</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>more stem cells are formed in control / jet lag reduces the release of stem cells into blood stream / greater range in control;<br />graph is rhythmic in control / control has more regular pattern;<br />greater number of stem cells produced in light period in control, whereas greater number in dark period in jet lag;<br />graph is shifted to the right in jet lag / stem cells are released later in time in jet lag;</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>b.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>(hypothesis supported in control) if stem cells are harvested towards the end of the dark period / (hypothesis supported) as stem cells start increasing in dark period;<br />(hypothesis not supported) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in control</span> as peak of stem cells occurs during light period/lowest number during dark period;<br />(hypothesis supported) if patient is jet-lagged as more stem cells are produced in dark period;</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>mRNA is translated to protein / involved in protein synthesis.</p>

</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>clenbuterol <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> isoprenaline both produce more stem cells than control;<br />clenbuterol releases fewer stem cells than isoprenaline / isoprenaline releases the most stem cells;<br />isoprenaline produces the least mRNA for CXCL12;<br />clenbuterol produces the same amount of mRNA for CXCL12 as control;</p>
