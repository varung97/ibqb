<p>vesicles formed from rER transport proteins to Golgi apparatus;<br />these vesicles fuse with membranes of Golgi apparatus;<br />proteins are processed as they move through Golgi apparatus;<br />(transport) vesicles bud off/leave Golgi apparatus;<br />vesicles move through cytoplasm;<br />(vesicles) fuse with plasma membrane;<br />contents released to outside of cell / exocytosis;<br />cells use vesicles to secrete substances such as hormones/digestive enzymes/other appropriate example;<br />vesicles may contain cell products other than proteins; <br /><em>Credit drawings which fully explain the points above.</em></p>

<p><em>To achieve <strong>[1]</strong> answer must name the structure and relate it to its function.<br /></em>the villus has a large surface area to volume ratio;<br />microvilli increase surface area for absorption;<br />thin surface (epithelial) layer so products of digestion can pass easily through;<br />channel proteins located in plasma membrane used for facilitated diffusion;<br />network of capillaries inside each villus (so only short distance) for movement of absorbed products;<br />capillaries transport absorbed nutrients/sugars and amino acids away from small intestine;<br />blood flow in capillaries maintains concentration gradient;<br />central lymph vessel/lacteal to transport absorbed fats/fatty acids away from small intestine;<br />large number of mitochondria provide ATP needed for active transport;<br />protein pumps in membrane (of microvilli) carry out active transport;<br />pinocytosis occurs at surface (epithelial) layer; <em><br />Accept any of the points above shown in a drawing.</em></p>
