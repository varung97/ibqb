<div class='question'>
<p>a. example of where this has been used <em>e.g.</em> Exxon Valdez spill, Alaska / other correct example;</p>
<p>b. indigenous/existing bacteria can break down oil;</p>
<p>c. bioremediation is the use of nutrients to enhance the activity of existing organisms / the addition of non-indigenous microorganisms;</p>
<p>d. converts the toxic compounds of oil to non-toxic products;</p>
<p>e. bioremediation is used after other cleanup methods have been used;</p>
<p>f. bioaugmentation is when bacteria are added to supplement the existing microbial population;</p>
<p>g. biostimulation is when nutrients are added to stimulate the growth of the existing oil-degrading bacteria;</p>
<p>h. bacteria added seem to compete poorly with the indigenous population;</p>
<p>i. nutrient concentrations have to be sufficient to support the maximal growth rate of the bacteria throughout the clean-up operation;</p>
