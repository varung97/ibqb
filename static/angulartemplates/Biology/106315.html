<div class='question'>
<p><em> definition: </em></p>
<p>insertion of genes / replacement of defective genes using a vector into non-germ line cells;</p>
<p><em>safety:</em></p>
<p>the DNA/viral vector may integrate into other parts of the genome;</p>
<p>causing problems of gene expression;</p>
<p>possibly cancer;</p>
<p>example of SCID treatment/leukemia;</p>
<p>the vector may trigger an immune response;</p>
<p>viral vectors may recombine with other viruses;</p>
<p>inadvertent modification of germ line cells;</p>
<p><em>conflict of interest:</em></p>
<p>the producers of gene vectors gain financially;</p>
<p>clinical trials must be free of bias from commercial sponsors;</p>
<p><em>ethics:</em></p>
<p>the vectors are tested on animals and may behave differently in humans;</p>
<p>unethical to use healthy humans in trials;</p>
<p>no gene therapy has been commercialized / no valuable results as yet;</p>
<p><em>Award <strong>[4 max]</strong> if responses do not address safety, conflict of interest and ethics.</em></p>
