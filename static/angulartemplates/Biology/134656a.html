<p>(ii)</p>
<p>a. cell cycle is a sequence of stages / cell cycle is G<sub>1</sub>, S, G<sub>2</sub> and mitosis</p>
<p>b. (control of the cell cycle) by cyclins/cyclin</p>
<p>c. levels of cyclins rise (and fall)/fluctuate during the cell cycle/surge at different times/have to reach a certain concentration</p>
<p>d. conditions inside as well as outside the cell affect regulation</p>
<p>e. four cyclins/different cyclins to enter different stages of/events in the cell cycle / cyclins regulate the sequence/timing of the cell cycle / cyclins trigger the next stages</p>
<p><em>The idea of different cyclins acting at different phases must be clear</em>.</p>
<p>f. cyclin-dependent kinases / cyclins bind to kinases and activate them</p>
<p>g. kinases phosphorylate other proteins</p>
<p>h. phosphorylated proteins perform specific functions in the cell cycle</p>
