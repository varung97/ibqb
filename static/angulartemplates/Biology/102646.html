<div class='question'>
<p>classification traditionally based on morphology;<br />cladistics (strength) based on molecular differences/base sequences/amino acid sequences;<br />cladistics (weakness) is based on probability but improbable events do occur, so relationships can be wrong;<br />clade includes ancestral species/descendants from that species;<br />members of clade share set of features not found in more distant relatives;<br />cladogram is a tree-like diagram where nodes/branches represent the splitting of (two) new groups from a common ancestor;<br />different cladograms can represent same relationships in a group;<br />cladogram timescale not necessary;<br />classification based on cladograms is often same as traditional classification;<br />in some groups cladograms have led to revised classification; <br /><em>Accept any of the above points shown in a clearly annotated diagram.</em></p>
