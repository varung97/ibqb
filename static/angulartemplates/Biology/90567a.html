<p>a. positive change/reduced loss for femoral neck at all levels whereas only at high intake for spine;<br />b. higher values for femoral neck for each intake category;<br />c. inversely proportional for both;<br />d. no overlap between range/standard deviation / clear distinction of protective effect between femoral neck and spine (for high/all intake categories);</p>

<p><em>Implications:</em><br />a. high intake results in positive value (for all locations);<br />b. protective effect proportional to intake;</p>
<p><em>Limitations:</em><br />c. proportion of vitamin C intake from supplements / influence of other factors not stated;<br />d. only a few bone locations measured / sample size unknown / high medium and low not defined; <br /><em>At least one implication and one limitation required.</em></p>
