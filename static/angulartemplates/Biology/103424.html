<p>ventilation is moving air into and out of lungs/inhalation and exhalation;<br />involves (respiratory) muscle activity;<br />gas exchange involves movement of carbon dioxide and oxygen;<br />between alveoli and blood (in capillaries) / between blood (in capillaries) and cells;<br />cell respiration is the release of energy from organic molecules/glucose;<br />(aerobic) cell respiration occurs in mitochondria; <br /><em>To award <strong>[4 max]</strong> responses must address ventilation, gas exchange and cell respiration.</em></p>

<p>during glycolysis glucose is partially oxidized in the cytoplasm;<br />(small amount/yield of) ATP produced;<br />(two) pyruvate formed by glycolysis;<br />pyruvate absorbed into/broken down in the mitochondrion;<br />requires oxygen;<br />carbon dioxide is produced;<br />water is produced;<br />large amount/yield of energy/ATP molecules (per glucose molecule);</p>

<p>collisions between enzyme/active site and substrate;<br />enzyme activity increases as temperature rises;<br />more frequent collisions at higher temperatures;<br />each enzyme has an optimum temperature / enzymes have optimal temperatures;<br />high temperatures (above optimum) denature enzymes;<br />each enzyme has an optimum pH / enzymes have optimal pHs;<br />increase <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> decrease from optimum pH decreases rate of reaction/activity;<br />extreme pH alters/denatures the tertiary/3D protein/enzyme structure;<br />increasing substrate concentration increases the rate of reaction;<br />higher substrate concentration increases chance of collision;<br />until plateau;<br />when all active sites are busy; <br /><em>Accept clearly annotated graph.</em></p>
