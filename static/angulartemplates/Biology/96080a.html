<p>DNA is double-stranded while RNA is single-stranded;<br />DNA contains deoxyribose while RNA contains ribose;<br />the base <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thymine</span> found in DNA is replaced by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">uracil</span> in RNA;<br />one form of DNA (double helix) but several forms of RNA (tRNA, mRNA and rRNA);</p>

<p>occurs during (S phase of) interphase/in preparation for mitosis/cell division;<br />DNA replication is semi-conservative;<br />unwinding of double helix / separation of strands by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">helicase</span> (at replication origin);<br />hydrogen bonds between two strands are broken;<br />each strand of parent DNA used as template for synthesis;<br />synthesis continuous on leading strand but not continuous on lagging strand;<br />leading to formation of Okazaki fragments (on lagging strand);<br />synthesis occurs in 5'&rarr;3' direction;<br />RNA primer synthesized on parent DNA using RNA primase;<br />DNA <span style="text-decoration: underline;">polymerase III </span>adds the nucleotides (to the 3' end)<br />added according to complementary base pairing;<br />adenine pairs with thymine and cytosine pairs with guanine; (<em>Both pairings required. Do not accept letters alone.</em>)<br />DNA <span style="text-decoration: underline;">polymerase I</span> removes the RNA primers and replaces them with DNA;<br />DNA ligase joins Okazaki fragments;<br />as deoxynucleoside triphosphate joins with growing DNA chain, two phosphates broken off releasing energy to form bond; <br /><em>Accept any of the points above shown on an annotated diagram.</em></p>

<p>they increase rate of (chemical) reaction;<br />remains unused/unchanged at the end of the reaction;<br />lower activation energy;<br />activation energy is energy needed to overcome energy barrier that prevents reaction;<br />annotated graph showing reaction with and without enzyme;<br />substrate joins with enzyme at active site;<br />to form enzyme-substrate complex;<br />active site/enzyme (usually) specific for a particular substrate;<br />enzyme binding with substrate brings reactants closer together to facilitate chemical reactions (such as electron transfer);<br />induced fit model / change in enzyme conformation (when enzyme-substrate/ES complex forms);<br />making the substrate more reactive;</p>
