<p><em>light: <strong>[2 max]</strong></em><br />rate increases with increasing light;<br />it reaches maximum then plateaus;<br />as all chloroplast molecules are working at optimal pace;</p>
<p><em>temperature: <strong>[2 max]</strong></em><br />rate increases with increasing temperature;<br />to a maximum/optimum temperature;<br />but then falls off rapidly;<br />as enzymes are denatured above the optimal temperature;</p>
<p><em>carbon dioxide: <strong>[2 max]</strong></em><br />rate increases with increasing carbon dioxide level;<br />it reaches maximum then plateaus;<br />as photosynthesis operating at optimal level;</p>

<p>increase in temperature is called global warming;<br />this is caused by the greenhouse effect;<br />a natural phenomenon that has occurred over millions of years;<br />main gas responsible is carbon dioxide;<br />other gases like methane/nitrous oxide also cause effect;<br />shortwave radiation from the Sun enters atmosphere;<br />warms the surface of the Earth;<br />longwave radiation emitted by the surface of the Earth;<br />is absorbed by carbon dioxide/greenhouse gases;<br />human use of fossil fuels has increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide;<br />rapid rise in temperatures over (approximately) hundred years;<br />cows/animals/peat bogs release methane;<br />greenhouse gases emitted by volcanic activity;</p>
