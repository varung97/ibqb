</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. in the Arctic ocean the surface area of sea ice has declined whereas in Antarctica the surface area has increased;<br />b. the rate of change is greater for the Arctic than for Antarctica;<br />c. there are greater fluctuations in the surface area of sea ice in Antarctica than in the Arctic;<br /><em>For mp a, it is acceptable if there is no comparative term such as &ldquo;whereas&rdquo; or &ldquo;but&rdquo;;</em></p>
<div class='question_part_label'>b.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. change / decrease / melting of sea ice is expected with global warming;<br />b. decrease of sea ice in Arctic is supportive evidence of global warming;<br />c. increase in sea ice in Antarctic is not supportive evidence of global warming;<br />d. Antarctic increase / both changes may be associated with climate change (caused by global warming);<br />e. global warming does not affect all areas in the same way / global warming has complex effects;<br />f. data is inconsistent/inconclusive / data on its own does not establish cause and effect / not over a very long period of time;<br /><br /></p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p><em>One mark for correct description of the trend off the Antarctic Peninsula and one mark for correct description for the Ross Sea; accept correct statements other than those listed in the scheme but do not award a mark for contradictions; marks can be awarded for correct statements about the sea ice season for Antarctica overall; Some students are referring to moving South in the Ross Sea when it is</em><br /><em>clear that they are moving North. If you can discern their intention, then give the BOD on this;</em></p>
<p>Antarctic Peninsula:<br />a. decrease/stable at the base of the peninsula / decrease in the area of the penguin colonies/West of the tip / increase/+1 above and below the peninsula / variable pattern;</p>
<p>Ross Sea:<br />b. sea ice is increasing / +1 in the Ross Sea / area below / North of the Ross Sea / lower Ross Sea / Southern part of Ross Sea/closest to the South pole is stable/no change to the length of the sea ice season / variable pattern;<br /><br /></p>
<div class='question_part_label'>d.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. (off AP) sea ice season has declined as has penguin population;<br />b. colony 2 and 3 sea ice season has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> declined <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> population increased;<br />c. colony 3 increase in population <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> growing length of sea ice season;<br />d. colony 2 has stable / increasing numbers <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> sea ice season is not changing;<br />e. colony size and sea ice season length/area are correlated;<br />f. Population numbers for colony 1 and 3 the same at start of study but both experience a big (opposite change);</p>
<p><em>Accept answers that refer to &ldquo;sea ice&rdquo; or &ldquo;sea ice area&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>e.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. global warming leads to climate / environmental change; <em>eg</em> temperature change / ice melting<br />b. stable ice associated with stable population / no climate change;<br />c. ice changes associated with population changes;<br />d. changes in penguin population size can indicate climate change / global warming;<br />e. example of how climate change can alter population; <em>eg</em> prey availability / habitat loss;<br />f. not all species will be affected in the same way (so care needed in applying conclusions more widely)<br />g. there is information on changes of population over the past 35 000 years;</p>
