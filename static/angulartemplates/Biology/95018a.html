<p>gene is a sequence of DNA bases;<br />DNA/gene codes for a specific sequence of amino acids/polypeptide;<br />enzymes are proteins/composed of polypetides;<br />sequence of amino acids determines tertiary structure/folding/shape of active site;<br />change in the gene/mutation will affect the active site/function of an enzyme;<br />enzymes are involved in replication/transcription of genes;<br />enzymes are involved in synthesis of polypeptides;</p>

<p>metabolic pathways can be a sequence/chain of reactions;<br />they can be cycles of reactions;<br />different enzymes control each reaction in the sequence/cycle;<br />accumulation of an end-product can inhibit the first enzyme of the sequence/ pathway;<br />(an end-product inhibitor) joins an allosteric site/a site separate from active site;<br />attachment at the allosteric site changes the shape of the active site;<br />preventing the binding of substrate;<br />until the level of the end-product is reduced (and the inhibition removed);<br />this is an example of negative feedback;</p>
