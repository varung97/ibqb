<p>individuals are more likely to breed if they are the same variety / individuals of different varieties have a low probability of breeding;<br />the probability of breeding between individuals of the same variety shows a large range of values / narrow range if of different variety;<br />the probability of breeding between any two individuals is always less than 0.6/correct numerical value;</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>data provides (strong) evidence for reproductive isolation between the varieties in each lake;<br />different sizes/feeding habits/habitat (shore versus open water) seem to contribute (strongly) to low breeding probability;<br />this could lead to speciation/formation of separate species in each lake;<br />same varieties from different lakes do not show strong reproductive isolation / geographical isolation is a weak factor in speciation / no evidence of allopatric speciation;<br />sympatric speciation seems to be taking place because different varieties from the same lake have a low probability of breeding;</p>
