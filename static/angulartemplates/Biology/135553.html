<p><em>Natural cycle</em></p>
<p>a. plants absorb phosphorus from the soil by the roots</p>
<p>b. soil phosphorus comes from weathered &laquo;phosphate&raquo; rocks</p>
<p>c. &laquo;soil/organic&raquo; phosphorus &laquo;also&raquo; comes from humus/plant/animal residues/guano/microorganisms</p>
<p>d. phosphorus is a limiting &laquo;macronutrient&raquo; factor in plant growth<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />phosphorus is necessary for vital functions/ATP/DNA<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />deficiency of phosphorus &laquo;in soil&raquo; limits plant growth/production&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Sustainability</em></p>
<p>e. &laquo;natural&raquo; phosphorus cycle is slow/not sustainable with increased crop production</p>
<p>f. phosphorus is replenished &laquo;in the soil&raquo; by use of mineral/organic fertilizers</p>
<p>g. phosphorus/phosphate is &laquo;mainly&raquo; mined from &laquo;phosphate&raquo; rocks</p>
<p>h. rocks are becoming used up/inaccessible so non-sustainable/non-renewable<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />the use of fertilizers is non-sustainable &laquo;with increased crop production&raquo;</p>
<p>i. increased demand for food/meat/dairy/grain increases demand for fertilizers</p>
<p>j. runoff/erosion/leaching of fertilizers decreases potential supply for crops/OWTTE</p>
