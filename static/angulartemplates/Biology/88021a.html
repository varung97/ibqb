(metaphase I) (homologous chromosomes) at the equator of the spindle / middle of cell;<br />e. (anaphase I) (homologous) chromosomes separate and move to opposite poles;<br />f. (telophase I) chromosomes reach poles and unwind <em>WTTE</em>;<br />g. (prophase II) chromosomes (condense and) become visible, new spindles form;<br />h. (metaphase II) chromosomes line up at the centre of the cells/equator;<br />i. (anaphase II) sister chromatids separate;<br />j. (telophase II) chromatids reach the poles and unwind;</p>

<p>a. therapeutic cloning involves producing embryos from which embryonic stem cells can be harvested for medical use;</p>
<p><em>argument in favour:</em><br />b. (to many people) any procedure that reduces pain and suffering is ethically/morally justified;<br />c. stem cells can be used to replace organs/tissues that have been lost/damaged in a patient;<br />d. (thus) pain and suffering can be reduced/lives can be saved/life quality improved;<br />e. cells can be removed from embryos that have stopped developing and would have died anyway;<br />f. cells are removed at a stage when no pain can be felt by the embryo;<br />g. use embryos from IVF that would otherwise be destroyed;</p>
<p><em>Accept up to one additional reasonable argument in favour. </em></p>
<p><em>argument against:</em><br />h. embryonic stem cells are no longer needed as adult stem cells can be used without causing loss of life;<br />i. there is danger of embryonic stem cells developing into tumour cells/harmful effects are not yet known;<br />j. every human embryo is a potential human with the right to development;<br />k. more embryos may be produced than can be used and so some would be killed;<br />l. (to many people) any procedure that harms a life/kills is unethical/morally wrong;<br /><em>Accept up to one additional reasonable argument against.</em></p>
