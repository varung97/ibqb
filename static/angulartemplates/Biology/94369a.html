<p>more ascorbic acid (40 mg) than dehydroascorbic acid (33 mg) is released/excreted;<br />more dehydroascorbic acid (16 mg) than ascorbic acid (10 mg) is released/excreted in the first three hours / dehydroascorbic acid peaks before ascorbic acid;<br />from six hours onwards more ascorbic acid is released than dehydroascorbic acid;<br />maximum release of dehydroascorbic acid at three hours whereas maximum release of ascorbic acid at six hours;<br />ascorbic acid release rises then falls whereas dehydroascorbic release falls (until 12 hours after loading);</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>both chemical forms are released/excreted so supplements need to be given regularly;<br />using dehydroascorbic acid instead of ascorbic acid does not improve vitamin C retention / dehydroascorbic acid could be marginally better as less is excreted;<br />study only looks at young/healthy/female subjects;<br />period of vitamin C deficiency is too short / need a longer period to allow scurvy to develop;</p>
