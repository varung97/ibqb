<p>a. (sodium channels/voltage-gated channels open and) Na+ diffuse into neuron (down concentration gradient);<br />b. inside of neuron becomes positive compared to outside / potential is reversed / depolarization;<br />c. wave of depolarization moves (down the membrane);<br />d. (potassium channels open and) K+ diffuse out (down concentration gradient);<br />e. inside becomes negative compared with outside / potential across membrane restored / repolarization;<br />f. active transport of K+ (into neuron) and Na+ (out of neuron) restores resting potential;</p>
