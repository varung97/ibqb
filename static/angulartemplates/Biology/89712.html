<p><em>Remember, up to TWO &ldquo;quality of construction&rdquo; marks per essay.</em></p>
<p>a. fossils (give evidence of evolution);<br />b. fossils show different species existed in the past/species changed over time;<br />c. selective breeding of (domesticated) animals/crop plants;<br />d. selective breeding shows that (artificial) selection can cause rapid change;<br />e. homologous (anatomical) structures/vestigial organs (give evidence of evolution);<br />f. homologous structures/pentadactyl limbs/other example show common ancestry;<br />g. DNA/base/amino acid sequences show (common) ancestry/species diverged;</p>
<p><em>Do not award marks for examples of evolution in response to environmental change such as melanism as this is tested in part (c) of this question.</em></p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p><em>Remember, up to TWO &ldquo;quality of construction&rdquo; marks per essay.</em></p>
<p><em>For each example:</em><br />a. a named example of a species that has evolved in this way;<br />b. description/clear statement of the change that occurred in the environment;<br />c. description/clear statement of different varieties (that existed at the same time);<br />d. explanation of/reason for one variant having a selective advantage;<br />e. the change in the population/species due to natural selection/evolution;<br /><em>Do not award the last mark if the change is explained using Lamarckism rather than natural selection.</em></p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br />f. <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>/MRSA/<em>Clostridium difficile</em>/other named species;<br />g. introduction/use of an antibiotic/named antibiotic;<br />h. some bacteria were resistant and others were not;<br />i. resistant bacteria survived (and multiplied) while non-resistant were killed;<br />j. percentage of the population showing resistance increased;</p>
<p><em><strong>[8]</strong> can be awarded if the candidate scores <strong>[5]</strong> for one example and <strong>[3]</strong> for the other.</em><br /><em>Do not accept examples where the evidence of evolution comes from fossils, or where the variation is not heritable.</em></p>
