<p>receptors in hypothalamus detect decrease in blood solute potential/increase in blood concentration;<br />occurs when excessive sweating/too little water intake/excessive salt intake;<br />nerve impulses pass to posterior pituitary gland where ADH is released;<br />ADH secreted by neurosecretory cells;<br />ADH makes epithelium of convoluted tubule /collecting duct more permeable to water;<br />water reabsorption results in more concentrated urine;<br />when high intake of water/solute potential of blood increases/blood more dilute ADH release is inhibited;<br />walls of convoluted tubule and collecting duct become less permeable to water;<br />less water is reabsorbed creating dilute urine;<br />is example of negative feedback;</p>
