<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. less transpiration/water loss as (atmospheric) humidity rises;</p>
<p>b. air spaces inside leaf are saturated/nearly saturated (with water vapour);</p>
<p>c. smaller concentration gradient with higher atmospheric humidity;</p>
<p>d. more transpiration/water loss as temperature rises/with more heat;</p>
<p>e. faster diffusion / more kinetic energy (of water molecules);</p>
<p>f. faster evaporation (due to more latent heat available);</p>
<p>g. more transpiration/water loss as wind (speed) increases;</p>
<p>h. humid air/water vapour blown away from the leaf;</p>
<p>i. increasing the concentration gradient (of water vapour);</p>
<p>j. more transpiration/water loss in the light;</p>
<p>k. light causes stomata to open / stomata closed in darkness;</p>
<p>l. low CO<sub>2 </sub>concentration inside leaf in bright light so stomata open wider;</p>
<p><em>Accept any of the points if clearly made on an annotated graph.</em></p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. coolant in sweat/in transpiration;</p>
<p>b. water has a high heat of vaporisation / heat taken when hydrogen bonds break;</p>
<p>c. water is cohesive so can pulled up/so can be moved under tension in xylem;</p>
<p>d. water is an excellent/universal solvent/dissolves many different substances;</p>
<p>e. medium for transport in blood/xylem/phloem;</p>
<p>f. medium for metabolic reactions / (metabolic) reactions happen dissolved in water;</p>
<p>g. surface tension due to cohesion allows organisms to live on water surface;</p>
<p>h. water has high heat capacity so much energy required to change its temperature;</p>
<p>i. ice floats so lakes/oceans do not freeze allowing life under the ice;</p>
<p>j. high heat capacity so stable habitat/so temperature of water changes slowly;</p>
<p>k. used in chemical reactions/photosynthesis/hydrolysis in organisms;</p>
