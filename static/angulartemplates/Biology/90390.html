<p><em>solvent: <strong>[2 max]</strong></em><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">good</span> solvent;<br />due to polarity of water molecules many different substances dissolve in it;<br />most chemical reactions of living organisms occur in solution / transport medium;</p>
<p><em>cohesion: <strong>[2 max]</strong></em><br />cohesive/cohesion between adjacent water molecules;<br />due to hydrogen bonds;<br />long columns of water in xylem/transpiration stream / surface tension;</p>
<p><em>heat: <strong>[2 max]</strong></em><br />high heat capacity / large amounts of energy needed to change temperature;<br />energy needed to break hydrogen bonds;<br />important habitat as temperature more stable / blood disperses heat through body;</p>
<p><em>cooling:<strong> [2 max]</strong></em><br />evaporative cooling / high heat of vaporization/latent heat;<br />heat used to break hydrogen bonds so water can change to gas;<br />cooling effect of transpiration on leaves/sweat evaporation from skin/dogs panting;</p>

<p>water is filtered freely from blood to Bowman&rsquo;s capsule;<br />majority/80 % of water in filtrate reabsorbed in proximal convoluted tubule;<br />water balance in blood controlled as filtrate passes through collecting duct;<br />descending loop of Henle has water channels/aquaporins/is permeable to water;<br />loop of Henle creates hypertonic conditions in medulla;<br />water moves from tubule to hypertonic more concentrated medulla;<br />ascending loop (of Henle) impermeable to water;<br />Na+/NaCl actively transported out of (thick portion of) ascending limb;<br />anti-diuretic hormone/ADH controls permeability of collecting duct to water;<br />ADH released when blood too concentrated/hypertonic / <em>vice versa;</em><br />aquaporin channels (in collecting duct) allow water to exit;<br />collecting duct passes through increasing gradient in kidney/medulla;<br />gradient causes reabsorption of more water by osmosis;<br />small volumes excreted if solute concentration too high/blood too concentrated / <em>vice versa</em>;<br /><br /><em>(Plus up to [2] for quality)</em></p>
