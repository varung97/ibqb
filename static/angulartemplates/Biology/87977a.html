</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. in Cayo and/or Toledo the high incidence seems to be associated with rivers;<br />b. however, along one river in Toledo there is no high incidence;<br />c. in Belize District there is low incidence along the river / high incidence away from the river;<br />d. Orange Walk/Stan Creek there is no clear association;<br />e. (consequently) association of rivers with high incidence of malaria is inconclusive OWTTE;</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>b.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. both are stable from 1989 to 1992;<br />b. both see upward spike in 1992;<br />c. Corozal reaches its peak (one year) earlier / vice versa;<br />d. Toledo rises after 1998 but Corozal continues to decline / Corozal at the end decreases almost to 0, while Toledo still have incidence at the end of the decade;<br />e. Toledo has a higher incidence (throughout the decade) / vice versa;<br />f. Toledo changes more rapidly than Corozal / vice versa; <br /><em>Do not award numerical comparisons.</em></p>

</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>insecticides used to kill <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mosquitoes</span> / more anti malarial drugs / drought/less water for mosquito breeding / increased drainage / improved education / more mosquito nets / other reasonable change in conditions<br /><em>Do not accept vaccines as they do not exist.</em></p>
<div class='question_part_label'>d (i).</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>drier climate/less rainfall / more predators / vegetation/ecology not favourable to mosquitoes / higher rainfall so faster flowing rivers/more educated inhabitants so more aware of dangers.</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>d (ii).</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>&nbsp;lowland broadleaf forest and broadleaf hill forests <em>(both required)</em></p>
<div class='question_part_label'>e.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>Toledo because it has the highest incidence of malaria in map/graph (and farmland has highest correlation to incidence of malaria in the table).</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>f.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. if farming provides habitat for mosquitoes, then reducing it could reduce malaria / <em>OWTTE</em>;<br />b. natural habitats provide predators, but farmland does not;<br />c. changing native vegetation is not practical since plants are adapted to their environment/organisms have specific adaptations to their environments;<br />d. might work to change broadleaf forest into mixed hill forest as much of broadleaf forest has high incidence of malaria and no part of mixed hill forest has high incidence of malaria / <em>OWTTE</em>;<br />e. loss of habitat/loss of biodiversity results in less stable environment;<br />f. the value of maintaining natural habitat must be balanced with the value of reduced malaria;<br />g. farmland feeds the population, so cannot be replaced / <em>OWTTE</em></p>
