<p>a. more oxygen in inhaled air than in exhaled air<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />mouse uses oxygen in respiration</p>
<p>b.carbon dioxide exhaled / produced by mouse is absorbed by the soda lime</p>
<p>Source/mouse must be mentioned for marking point b &ndash; not just &ldquo;soda-lime absorbs C0<sub>2</sub>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>c. difference in volume is oxygen used by mouse<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />the volume/concentration/pressure of oxygen in the jar falls</p>
<p>d. &laquo;this&raquo; sucks the coloured liquid up the tube</p>
<p>e. volume of oxygen consumed equals the increase in volume of coloured water in the tube</p>

<p>b. plants use carbon dioxide (released by respiration)</p>
<p>c. if carbon dioxide is too low in concentration then photosynthesis will be eliminated/reduced</p>
<p>d. results in an inaccurate/low measure of the oxygen that is consumed</p>
<p>e. perform experiment in dark to prevent photosynthesis<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />cover bell jar to exclude light to prevent photosynthesis</p>
