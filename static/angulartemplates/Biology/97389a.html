<p>&alpha; cells (of pancreas) produce glucagon;<br />glucagon promotes release of glucose/breakdown of glycogen by liver cells;<br />glucagon secreted when blood glucose levels are low / raises blood glucose levels;<br />&beta; cells (of pancreas) produce insulin;<br />insulin promotes glucose uptake/storage of glycogen by liver/body/muscle cells;<br />insulin secreted when blood glucose levels are high / lowers blood glucose levels;<br />negative feedback mechanism; <em><br />Do not accept answers implying that insulin or glucagon catalyse glucose-glycogen conversions directly.<br />Award <strong>[3 max]</strong> if the response suggests that the hypothalamus has a role in regulation of blood glucose.</em></p>
