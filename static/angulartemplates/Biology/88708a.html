<p>a. sliding filament model / filaments/actin and myosin slide past each other;<br />b. action potential/depolarisation/nerve <span style="text-decoration: underline;">impulse</span> arrives at end of motor neurone;<br />c. neurotransmitter/acetylcholine released causing action potential (in muscle fibre);<br />d. sarcoplasmic reticulum releases calcium ions;<br />e. calcium ions cause binding sites on actin/for myosin to be exposed;<br />f. myosin heads bind to sites on actin/form cross-bridges;<br />g. myosin (head) moves actin filament using energy from ATP;<br />h. actin moved towards the centre of sarcomere/M line/M band;<br />i. sarcomeres shortened;<br />j. (binding of) ATP causes release of myosin head from actin;<br />k. conversion of ATP to ADP and Pi causes myosin heads to change angle;<br />l. cycle (of events) repeated (during muscle contraction); <br /><em>Accept the above points in annotated diagrams.</em></p>

<p><em>during inhalation:</em><br />a. external intercostal muscles contract moving rib cage up and out;<br />b. diaphragm contracts becoming lower/flatter;<br />c. increase in volume <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> decrease in pressure (of thorax);<br />d. air flows into lungs as atmospheric pressure is higher;</p>
<p><em>during exhalation:</em><br />e. internal intercostal muscles contract so ribs move in and down;<br />f. diaphragm relaxes and returns to domed shape;<br />g. decrease in volume and (therefore) increase in pressure (of thorax);<br />h. air moves out until pressure in lungs falls/is equal to atmospheric pressure;<br />i. abdominal muscles can be used to make a stronger/forced exhalation;<em><br /></em></p>
