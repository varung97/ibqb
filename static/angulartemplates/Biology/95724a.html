<p>genes that are located on just one of the sex chromosomes/X or Y are sex-linked;<br />(sex-linked) genes present on the X chromosome are absent from the Y chromosome / <em>vice versa</em>;<br />named <span style="text-decoration: underline;">recessive</span> X-linked condition (e.g. colour blindness / haemophilia / other valid example);<br />sex-linked conditions tend to be more commonly expressed in males;<br />female can be homozygous or heterozygous/carrier for a sex-linked/X-linked condition;<br />affected males have only one copy of the gene / have carrier daughters but cannot pass the condition on to sons;<br />carrier/heterozygous females can have affected sons/carrier daughters;<br />for a female to be affected (homozygous recessive) the father must be affected;</p>
<p><em>If the example used is of a recessive X-linked condition, use marking points c&ndash;h.</em><br /><em>Make appropriate adjustments if the example is of a dominant X-linked trait or a Y-linked trait.</em><br /><em>Accept any of the above points shown in a suitable diagram/chart/Punnett square/pedigree.</em></p>

<p><em>Definition and construction of karyotypes:</em><br />karyotype is the number and type / image of chromosomes in a cell;<br />cells collected from chorionic villus / by amniocentesis;<br />requires cells in metaphase / stimulate cells to divide and reach metaphase;<br />burst cells and spread chromosomes / photo taken of chromosomes;<br />chromosomes are arranged in pairs;<br />according to size/structure/position of centromere/banding pattern;</p>
<p><em>Uses for karyotypes:</em><br />karyotypes used to identify sex/gender;<br />male is XY and female XX;<br />used to identify chromosome mutations/abnormal numbers/non-disjunction;<br />Down syndrome due to extra chromosome 21 / other trisomy/aneuploidy example;<br />used for pre-natal diagnosis of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">chromosome</span> abnormalities;<br />may lead to a decision to abort the fetus;<br />prepare for consequences of abnormality in offspring;</p>
