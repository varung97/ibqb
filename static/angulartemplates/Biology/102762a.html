<p><em>size</em>:<br />large nature reserves usually promote conservation better than small ones;<br />large areas needed for far-ranging animals (e.g. grizzly bear);<br />larger areas have proportionally smaller perimeters/less affected by edges;</p>
<p><em>edge effect</em>:<br />ecology of edges of ecosystems is different from central areas due to edge effects;<br />fragmentation (of forests) leads to increase in edges which will favour some species over others;</p>
<p><em>habitat corridor</em>:<br />habitat/movement/wildlife corridors allow organisms to move between different parts of fragmented habitat;</p>
<p><em>To award<strong> [3]</strong> responses must refer to size, edge effect and habitat corridor.</em></p>
