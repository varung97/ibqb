<div class='question'>
<p>a. phosphorus in rock (reserves) enters slowly into the biosphere by weathering </p>
<p>b. mining of phosphorus (-bearing) rocks accelerates the natural cycle/faster than natural erosion </p>
<p>c. (mined) phosphorus is made into fertilizers/animal feeds/other products</p>
<p><em><strong>OR</strong></em></p>
<p>artificial fertilizers contain phosphate </p>
<p>d. (phosphorous products) transported to agricultural areas (all over the world) </p>
<p>e. with use of fertilizers phosphorus makes its way into the soil </p>
<p>f. run-off/drainage from farms causes phosphorus to move into aquatic ecosystems </p>
<p>g. use of detergents adds phosphorus to water </p>
<p>h. release of sewage adds phosphorus to water </p>
<p>i. excess phosphorus can lead to over growth of algae and plants in water </p>
<p>j. decomposition of dead plant material (by bacteria) use up all the oxygen in the water/increase BOD</p>
<p><em><strong>OR</strong></em></p>
<p>decomposition of dead plant material causes eutrophication </p>
<p>k. «eutrophication» can kill fish and other plants / is negative for ecosystems </p>
<p>l. phosphorus removed (from ecosystem) by the harvesting of agricultural crops</p>
