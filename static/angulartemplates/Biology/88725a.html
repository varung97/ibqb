<p>a. (all three) <em>Canis</em> populations show a mixture of haplotypes from two (or more) origins;<br />b. Minnesota-northwestern wolves have a mixture of haplotypes from grey wolf/<em>C. lupus</em> and eastern wolf/<em>C. lycaon</em>;<br />c. southern Ontario coyote has mixture of haplotypes from western coyote/<em>C. latrans</em> and eastern wolf;<br />d. northeastern coyote has mixture of haplotypes from western coyote/<em>C. latrans</em> and eastern wolf;</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. both contain haplotypes C1, C9 and C19;<br />b. C19 haplotype in greater proportion in northeastern coyotes / vice versa;<br />c. C9 haplotype in greater proportion in southern Ontario coyotes / vice versa;<br />d. C1 in smaller proportion in southern Ontario than northeastern coyotes / vice versa;<br />e. southern Ontario coyotes / northeastern coyotes have more haplotypes from coyotes than wolves;<br />f. fewer haplotypes from other sources in northeastern coyotes / vice versa;</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>b.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>no overlapping ranges since no haplotypes/C9, C19 from western coyotes present with haplotype/C22 from grey wolf in any of the hybrids.</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>northeastern coyote has greater proportion of C1/ haplotype from (eastern) wolf (than southern Ontario coyote)</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>d.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. all three show evidence that the eastern wolf was their ancestor/all have haplotypes from the eastern wolf;<br />b. southern Ontario and northeastern coyotes have different eastern wolf haplotypes from the Minnesota northwestern wolf / southern Ontario and northeastern coyotes have C1 while the Minnesota northwestern wolf has C3 and C13;</p>
