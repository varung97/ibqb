<p>(mono-, di- and polysaccharides) consist of one, two and many units;<br />example of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">monosaccharide</span> (e.g. glucose/ribose/galactose/fructose);<br />example of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">disaccharide</span> (e.g. maltose/lactose/sucrose);<br />example of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">polysaccharide</span> (e.g. starch/glycogen/cellulose)</p>

<p>digestion is the breakdown of large molecules into small molecules;<br />to allow diffusion / to make food soluble;<br />so foods can be absorbed into the bloodstream/body;<br />so foods can move from bloodstream into cells;<br />small molecules can be joined to form the organism&rsquo;s (unique) macromolecules;<br />hydrolysis is aided by enzymes;<br />hydrolysis requires water;<br />polysaccharides (hydrolysed) to disaccharides/monosaccharides/specific example;<br />proteins/polypeptides (hydrolysed) to amino acids;<br />fats/lipids/triglycerides (hydrolysed) to fatty acids and glycerol;</p>

<p>inhibitors reduce enzyme activity/reduce the rate of reaction;</p>
<p><em>Competitive inhibitors</em>:<br />have a similar shape to the substrate;<br />bind to/attach to/enter the active site;<br />block/compete for occupation of the active site / prevent substrate binding;<br />example (<em>e.g.</em> succinate dehydrogenase by malonate);<br />increase in substrate concentration reduces inhibition / graph showing this;</p>
<p><em>Non-competitive inhibitors</em>:<br />not chemically similar / different shape to substrate;<br />attach to a different part of the enzyme/allosteric site;<br />shape of the active site changes preventing/reducing substrate binding;<br />example of non-competitive inhibition (<em>e.g.</em> respiratory enzymes by cyanide);<br />increases in substrate concentration do not reduce inhibition / graph showing this;<br />end-product inhibitors are non-competitive;</p>
