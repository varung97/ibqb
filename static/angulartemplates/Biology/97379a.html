<p>fibrous proteins are strands/sheets whereas globular proteins are rounded;<br />fibrous proteins (usually) insoluble whereas globular proteins (usually) soluble;<br />globular more sensitive to changes in pH/temperature/salt than fibrous;<br />fibrous proteins have structural roles / other specific role of fibrous protein;<br />globular proteins used for catalysis/transport/other specific role of globular protein;<br />another role of globular protein;<br />named fibrous proteins <em>e.g.</em> keratin/fibrin/collagen/actin/myosin/silk protein;<br />named globular protein <em>e.g.</em> insulin/immunoglobulin/hemoglobin/named enzyme; <br /><em>Do not accept statements about fibrous proteins having only secondary structure and globular proteins having only tertiary structure.</em></p>

<p>auxin is a plant hormone;<br />produced by the tip of the stem/shoot tip;<br />causes transport of hydrogen ions from cytoplasm to cell wall;<br />decrease in pH / H<sup>+</sup> pumping breaks bonds between cell wall fibres;<br />makes cell walls flexible/extensible/plastic/softens cell walls;<br />auxin makes cells enlarge/grow;<br />gene expression also altered by auxin to promote cell growth;<br />(positive) phototropism is growth towards light;<br />shoot tip senses direction of (brightest) light;<br />auxin moved to side of stem with least light/darker side</p>
<p>causes cells on dark side to elongate/cells on dark side grow faster; <em><br />Accept clearly annotated diagrams for phototropism marking points.</em></p>
