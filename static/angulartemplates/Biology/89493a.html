<p>a. both increase (over the 25% water content);</p>
<p>b. (chlorophyll in) shade plants increase to almost the same/slightly less than original levels;</p>
<p>c. plants grown in sunlight have almost the same/slightly more than original levels;</p>

<div class='question_part_label'>c.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. decrease in chlorophyll causes lowered rate of light dependent reaction/less absorption of light energy;</p>
<p>b. decrease in CO<sub>2 </sub>assimilation causes lowered rate of light independent reaction/ less CO<sub>2 </sub>fixation/Calvin cycle;</p>
<p>c. both stages reduced due to wilting/less surface of leaf/closure of stomata;</p>
