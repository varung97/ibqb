<p>as latitude increases so does wing size / direct relationship / positive correlation<br />(<em>do not accept directly proportional as line does not pass through the origin</em>)</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>at higher latitudes/above 45&deg; European species have larger wings than American species/largest wing sizes seen in European flies;<br />European flies show more variation than American flies (steeper curve);<br />at lower latitudes/below 45&deg; North American flies have larger wings than European species;<br />South American flies have smaller wing size than European/ N. American flies;</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>b (i).</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>American species show less variation because they have had less time to diverge / evolve;<br />size of American flies closer to that of flies recently introduced/founder effect / European founder population from low latitudes;<br />American flies exposed to different selective pressures;</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>b (ii).</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>isolated populations diverge (genetically) / separation of gene pools;<br />may become a new species / allopatric speciation;<br />wing size will follow same trend as in Europe as population spreads (to higher latitudes because larger size favored by higher latitudes/colder climate);<br />wing size may stay small due to smaller gene pool/different climate;</p>
