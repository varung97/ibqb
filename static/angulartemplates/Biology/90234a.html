<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. plasmids are removed/obtained from bacteria;<br />b. endonuclease/restriction enzymes cut the plasmids at target sequences;<br />c. DNA fragments of other organism are cut with the same restriction enzymes;<br />d. in both DNA and plasmid, complementary sticky ends/staggered cut are produced;<br />e. DNA segment added to the opened plasmid;<br />f. spliced together by ligase;<br />g. reverse transcriptase makes DNA copies of mRNA / DNA polymerase to increase the amount of DNA;<br />h. recombinant plasmids inserted into new/host cells;<br />i. cultured/cloned to produce the new genes/more genetically modified cells; <br /><em>Award [3 max] if no specific enzyme names are given.</em><br /><em>Do not accept the word &ldquo;enzyme&rdquo; on its own.</em></p>
<div class='question_part_label'>b.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p><em>pH:</em><br />a. enzymes have an optimal pH/work best at a given pH;<br />b. activity increases as pH gets closer to optimal pH;<br />c. extreme pH denatures enzymes;<br />d. by breaking bonds / changing enzyme shape/structure / active site shape/structure;</p>
<p><em>substrate:</em><br />e. as substrate concentration increases, activity increases;<br />f. as substrate concentration increases, the collisions between substrate and enzyme increase;<br />g. up to a maximal level of action / reaching a plateau;<br />h. all active sites are saturated/occupied;</p>
<p><em>temperature:</em><br />i. enzymes have an optimal temperature (where they work most effectively);<br />j. activity increases as it gets closer to optimal temperature;<br />k. high temperatures stop enzyme activity due to irreversible changes in structure / denaturation;<br />l. by breaking bonds / changing enzyme shape/structure / active site shape/structure; <br /><em>Award any of the above points in an annotated graph.</em><br /><em>Award up to <strong>[8]</strong> if all three addressed and <strong>[6 max]</strong> if only two addressed.</em></p>
