<p>electrons are passed along electron transport system (on inner membrane of mitochondria);<br />energy is released as electrons move from one carrier to next;<br />carrier is oxidized as it loses an electron to the next carrier, which becomes reduced;<br />energy released during electron transport causes proton pumping;<br />H<sup>+</sup> pumped against concentration gradient from matrix to intermembrane space;<br />H<sup>+</sup> moves down concentration gradient back through inner membrane/ ATP synthase;<br />passage of H<sup>+</sup> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">through ATP synthase</span> causes phosphorylation of ADP/ production of ATP;</p>
