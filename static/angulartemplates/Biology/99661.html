<p>plant distribution closely linked to levels of abiotic factors in the environment;<br />given organism can survive only within a certain temperature range to which it is adapted;<br />water is a limiting factor in most terrestrial ecosystems and plants are classified according to ability to tolerate water shortage;<br />most plants can only tolerate narrow pH range;<br />light intensity/quality/wavelength and duration/photoperiod are important for photosynthesis;<br />most plants cannot tolerate large fluctuations in salinity/high salinity;<br />mineral nutrients affect plant fertility/soil structure/water retention; <br /><em>Accept ONE correct reference to herbivore activity</em></p>
