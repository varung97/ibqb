<p>transpiration is water loss (from plant) by evaporation;<br />flow of water through xylem from roots to leaves is the transpiration stream;<br />evaporation from spongy mesophyll cells;<br />replaced by osmosis from the xylem;<br />(diffusion of water vapour) through stomata;<br />water lost replaced from xylem / clear diagram showing movement of water from xylem through cell(s) (walls) to air space;<br />water pulled out of xylem creates suction/low pressure/tension; transpiration pull results;<br />water molecules stick together/are cohesive;<br />due to hydrogen bonding/polarity of water molecules;<br />xylem vessels are thin (hollow) tubes;<br />adhesion between water and xylem due to polarity of water molecules;<br />creates continuous column/transpiration stream;</p>

<p>flowering affected by light;<br />phytochrome;<br />exists in two (interconvertible) forms/P<sub>fr</sub> and P<sub>r</sub>;<br />P<sub>r</sub> (red absorbing/660 nm) converted to P<sub>fr</sub> (far-red/730 nm absorbing) in red or day light;<br />sunlight contains more red than far red light so P<sub>fr</sub> predominates during the day;<br />gradual reversion of P<sub>fr</sub> to P<sub>r</sub> occurs in darkness;<br />P<sub>fr</sub> is active form / P<sub>r</sub> is inactive form;<br />in long-day plants, flowering induced by dark periods shorter than a critical length / occurs when day is longer than a critical length;<br />enough P<sub>fr</sub> remains in long-day plants at end of short nights to stimulate flowering;<br />P<sub>fr</sub> acts as promoter of flowering in long-day plants;<br />short-day plants induced to flower by dark periods longer than a critical length/days shorter than a critical value;<br />at end of long nights enough P<sub>fr</sub> has been converted to P<sub>r</sub> to allow flowering to occur;<br />P<sub>fr</sub> acts as inhibitor of flowering in short-day plants;</p>
