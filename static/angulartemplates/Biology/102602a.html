<p>CXCL12 inhibition initially decreases occurrence of diabetes;<br />in the first 25 / up to 26/27/28 weeks;<br />CXCL12 inhibition does not prevent occurrence of diabetes (just delays it) / eventually the same level of diabetes</p>

<p>CXCL12 breakdown allows stem cell mobilization reducing incidence of diabetes / stem cells from the bone marrow can regenerate the islets (in pancreas)</p>

<p>isoprenaline is an inhibitor of CXCL12 / inhibits synthesis of CXCL12 mRNA;<br />delays onset of diabetes / allows stem cell mobilization / allows islet regeneration;<br />does not cure the disease;</p>

<p>suffering of patients could be reduced / diseases could be cured / better treatments developed / might replace treatment with cure;<br />(possibly) less cost than treating disease/diabetes;<br />specific example of ethical conflict; (<em>e.g. patient groups support use of embryotic stem cells but religious groups oppose / different views on the moral status of an embryo</em>)<br />restrictions on research in some countries due to cultural/religious traditions;<br />still in experimental stages / risk to patient;<br />specific example of risk; (<em>e.g. stem cells developing into tumours / rejection / need for immunosuppressants</em>)<br />death of early-stage embryos / production of embryos for stem cell research;<br />use of stem cells from adults/patients could overcome these objections;</p>
