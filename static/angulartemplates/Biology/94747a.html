<p>more evenly distributed in summer than in winter (across latitudes);<br />many near Cape Hatteras/35.0/2&ndash;35.4/6 &deg;N in winter/more than in summer;<br />more dolphins overall in the survey area in winter than in summer;<br />wider summer range / reaches 36.6 and 34.2 &deg;N/ less far N and S in winter;<br />unimodal distribution in winter versus bimodal in summer / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>

<p>male dolphin with the lowest body mass has the highest LCT<sub>w</sub>;<br />with larger dolphins/above 180/185/187 kg no change in LCT<sub>w</sub> with body mass;<br />weak negative correlation / as mass increases LCT<sub>w</sub> drops / <em>vice versa</em>;<br />uncertainty due to small amount of data;</p>

<p><em>Accept any of the following points about the female:</em><br />older so (possibly) has a lower metabolic rate / other result of age;<br />higher surface area to volume ratio (than male);<br />less active than males so releasing less metabolic heat;<br />less insulation due to subcutaneous fat/adipose tissue;<br />suckling / pregnant / part of mass was fetus;</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>supported as water temperature affects metabolic rate;<br />supported as dolphins will avoid areas with water below their LCT<sub>w</sub>;<br />water temperature is unlikely to be a factor for bigger males;<br />wide (latitude) range in summer suggests temperature does not determine range;<br />few animals / only one female / only narrow range of latitudes investigated;<br />data may not be reliable since the study was conducted in captivity;</p>

<p>may migrate/move range further north;<br />migrate to area with cooler/suitable water temperature;<br />ocean currents may change;<br />most productive waters/food supply may be further north;<br />distribution more spread out (due to warmer waters in more areas);</p>
