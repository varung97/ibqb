<p>water has a high specific heat capacity;</p>
<p>a large amount of heat causes a small increase in temperature;</p>
<p>water has a high latent heat of vaporization;</p>
<p>a large amount of heat energy is needed to vaporize/evaporate water;</p>
<p>hydrogen bonds between water molecules make them cohesive/stick together;</p>
<p>this gives water a high surface tension / explains how water rises up xylem;</p>
<p>water molecules are polar;</p>
<p>this makes water a good solvent;</p>
<p><em>Award <strong>[4 max]</strong> if thermal, cohesive and solvent properties are not all mentioned.</em></p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>process of water balance is called osmoregulation;</p>
<p>water passes into the kidney tubules by ultrafiltration;</p>
<p>water is reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule;</p>
<p>water reabsorbed into blood from the (descending limb) of the loop of Henle;</p>
<p>process by osmosis;</p>
<p>transport of salts into the medulla of kidney;</p>
<p>changes salt concentration so water is reabsorbed;</p>
<p>ADH released into blood when water is required;</p>
<p>ADH causes concentrated urine / no/low ADH causes dilute urine;</p>
<p>this causes more reabsorption of water from the collecting duct;</p>
<p>excess water is released as urine;</p>
<p>urine concentration depends on the body&rsquo;s need for water;</p>
<p>drinking a lot gives dilute urine;</p>
