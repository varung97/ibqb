<p>those proposing something must prove that it causes no harm;<br />before they start to do it;<br />objectors do not have to prove that there will be harm;<br />activities that risk/threaten/may cause harm are banned;<br />trials/tests must be done first;<br />precautionary principle is applied when possible consequences are severe;<br />precautionary principle should be used in the case of global warming;<br />action should be taken to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions before proved it is the cause;<br />another example of implementation of the precautionary principle;</p>
