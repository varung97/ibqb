<p>altering a base (in DNA) is a (point) mutation;<br />only has an effect if base is in a gene;<br />when mRNA is produced by transcription one mRNA base is different;<br />one codon in mRNA is different;<br />one amino acid is different in the polypeptide;<br />polypeptide produced by translation of mRNA;<br />some base changes do not change the amino acid coded for;<br />structure of polypeptide /protein may be altered;<br />usually the polypeptide/protein does not function as well;</p>
<p><em>example given:</em><br /><em>disease</em>: sickle cell anemia;<br /><em>mutation</em>: GAG to GTG;<br /><em>consequence in translation</em>: glutamic acid to valine;<br /><em>consequence for protein</em>: hemoglobin altered so sickle cell formed;<br /><em>consequence for individual</em>: less oxygen can be carried;</p>
