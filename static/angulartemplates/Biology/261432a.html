<p>c. sunlight/light/(solar) radiation passes through the atmosphere (to reach the Earth’s surface) </p>
<p>d. CO<sub>2</sub> in atmosphere/greenhouse gases absorb/trap/reflect back some radiation/heat (emitted by the Earth’s surface) </p>
<p>e. CO<sub>2</sub> in atmosphere/greenhouse gases allow <span>short wave</span> radiation to pass (through atmosphere) but absorb <span>long wave</span>/<span>infra-red</span> </p>
<p>f. solar radiation/sunlight is (mostly) short wave </p>
<p>g. radiation/heat emitted by the Earth is long wave/infra-red</p>
