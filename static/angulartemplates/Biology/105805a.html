<p>cells undergoing mitosis are used for karyotyping;</p>
<p>process of mitosis is stopped at (mitotic) metaphase;</p>
<p>chromosomes (cut from photographs) are arranged in pairs of similar structure/ homologous chromosomes;</p>
<p>allows abnormalities in the chromosome number/appearance to be seen;</p>
<p>any valid example <em>(e.g. in Down syndrome / gender of fetus)</em>;</p>
<p>detected by identifying unique feature (<em>e.g.</em> trisomy 21 / one extra chromosome / 47 chromosomes);</p>
<p><em>Award <strong>[3 max]</strong> for an example with no description of karyotyping</em>.</p>

<p>restriction enzymes/endonucleases cut a small fragment of DNA from an organism;</p>
<p>same restriction enzymes used to cut DNA of plasmid / <em>e.g.</em> <em>E. coli</em>;</p>
<p>sticky ends are the same in both cases;</p>
<p>fragment of DNA is inserted into the plasmid;</p>
<p>spliced together by ligase;</p>
<p>to make recombinant DNA/plasmids;</p>

<p>genetic modification is when the DNA/genotype of an organism is artificially changed;</p>
<p>genetic modification alters some characteristic/phenotype of the organism;</p>
<p><strong>named</strong> example with modification (<em>e.g.</em> salt tolerance in tomato plants);</p>
<p><em>benefits: <strong>[5 max] </strong></em></p>
<p>allows crops to be grown where they would not grow naturally;</p>
<p>provides more food;</p>
<p>economic benefits;</p>
<p>expands world&rsquo;s productive farmland;</p>
<p>reduces the need to clear rainforests to grow crops;</p>
<p>lowers cost of production;</p>
<p>less pesticides/fertilizers/chemicals needed so better for environment;</p>
<p><em>Award marks for any valid benefit consistent with a <strong>named</strong> example.</em></p>
<p><em>harmful effects: <strong>[5 max]</strong></em></p>
<p>may be released into natural environment;</p>
<p>may affect food chains / unintended effects on other organisms;</p>
<p>may affect consumers e.g. allergies/health risks;</p>
<p>unfair to smaller farmers who cannot compete;</p>
<p>long-term effects are unknown; risk of cross-pollination;</p>
<p>risk of long-term contamination of soil;</p>
