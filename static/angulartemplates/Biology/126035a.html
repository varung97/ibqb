<div class='question'>
<p>Sampling does not count every organism so may not be a true estimate</p>
<p>Highly mobile marine animals unevenly distributed so difficult to estimate population size</p>
<p>Transects/quadrats used to estimate populations of stationary organisms</p>
<p>Useful on rocky shores/beaches/intertidal zones/reef</p>
<p>Estimation of mobile larval stages of stationary organisms/coral more difficult</p>
<p>Capture-mark-release-recapture useful for mobile animals in restricted environments (V<em>ice versa</em>)</p>
<p>Example of organism can estimate by this technique</p>
<p>Drawback of technique</p>
<p>Echolocation/sonar used to estimate the population size of fish that form shoals</p>
<p>Echolocation cannot distinguish between species (<em>Accept other valid limitation</em>)</p>
<p>The age structure of &laquo;commercially&raquo; caught fish can be used to estimate population size</p>
<p>Restricted-age fish &laquo;as bycatch&raquo; dumped before landing so biased estimates<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />Depends on accuracy/honesty of those catching fish</p>
