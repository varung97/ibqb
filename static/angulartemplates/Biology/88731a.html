<div class='question'>
<p>a. cladistics uses cladograms/tree diagrams;<br />b. show clades/branches (in parallel) that begin at a point/node;<br />c. each clade includes a (common) ancestral organism/node and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> its descendents;<br />d. members of a clade share derived/inherited characteristics;<br />e. clades are nested/subsets of larger clades;<br />f. cladograms show evolutionary history/origin of organisms / phylogeny;<br />g. branch length (of clade) can indicate (relative) amount of genetic change/time;<br />h. clades based on (objective) molecular analysis/genetic evidence / differ in amino acid sequences/DNA base changes/mutations;<br />i. fewest number of differences/maximum parsimony determines branch separation;<br />j. predictability of DNA base changes/mutation rates suggests evolutionary timelines;<br />k. problems arise when gene change varies (greatly) from one gene to the next;<br />l. cladograms may not match traditional/Linnaean classification;<br />m. (mismatch) prompts re-examination of data / reclassification of a group; <br /><em>Some of the above points may be included in a correctly annotated diagram clearly stating above points.</em></p>
