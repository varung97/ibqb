<p>(peptides) A, B, C and H more abundant in pollen foragers;<br />(peptides) D, E, F and G more abundant in nectar foragers;<br />greater abundance (differences) for nectar foragers;<br />A and C showed little difference; <br /><em>Do not accept numerical statements only.</em></p>

<p><em>(arguments supporting the hypothesis</em>)<br />each group of foragers is always associated with the same group of peptides;<br />trends inverse between nectar (foragers) and pollen (foragers)/arriving and departing / <em>OWTTE</em>;<br />error bars on the graph show that the differences are likely to be significant;</p>
<p>(<em>arguments not supporting the hypothesis</em>)<br />no data about nectar/pollen actually collected / sample size;<br />there is no evidence of causation/that the peptide in the brain is determining the type of foraging itself;</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>(predisposition/instinct/natural selection) ensures that both pollen and nectar will be collected;<br />allows the bees to collect whichever food source is in abundance at the time / increases food collection efficiency;<br />both pollen and nectar are diet requirements;<br />this behaviour is part of division of labour/specialization;</p>
