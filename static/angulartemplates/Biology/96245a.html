<p>on Day 3 little/no difference / both levels very low;<br />protein increases in both during the experiment; <em>Can be mentioned in separate parts of the responses.</em><br />protein higher in PAN-only group by an increasing amount / increases faster in PAN-only group;<br />protein levels are higher in the PAN-only group on all days / after Day 3 / on Day 6 and day 9; <em>Accept comparative statements such as more than double.</em><br />145 versus 45 on Day 6 / 350 versus 110 on Day 9 / increase from Day 3 to Day 6 is 130 versus 35 / increase from Day 6 to Day 9 is<br />205 versus 65; <em>Allow answers in the range of 5%. </em><em>Accept numerical comparisons </em><em>expressed as percentages.</em></p>
