<p>heat causes vasodilation of arterioles;<br />blood closer to surface so heat loss from skin;<br />heat causes sweating (from sweat glands);<br />evaporation of sweat leads to cooling;<br />cold causes vasoconstriction of arterioles;<br />less blood at surface so less heat loss from skin;<br />cold leads to less sweating/evaporation of water from skin / hair becomes erect and traps air/goose bumps appear;<br />temperature receptors in skin transmit impulses to the hypothalamus;</p>
