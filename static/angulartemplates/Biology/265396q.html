<p>What is a requirement for accurate measurements of the rate of respiration using a respirometer?</p>
<p>A. CO<sub>2</sub> must be absorbed by water so that only O<sub>2</sub> production is measured.</p>
<p>B. Temperature must be kept constant so the volume changes are only due to O<sub>2</sub> use.</p>
<p>C. Anaerobic organisms are better to use than aerobic ones as they will produce larger volume changes.</p>
<p>D. Warm-blooded animals are better to use than cold-blooded animals as they do not change the temperature of the container.</p>
