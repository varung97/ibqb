<p>rods and cones are both light-sensitive cells;<br />rods are far more numerous than cones;<br />rods are distributed evenly throughout the retina while cones are particularly concentrated at and around the fovea;<br />rod cells are all the same/black and white vision but there are three types of cone cells (absorb red, blue and green colour)/colour vision;<br />rod cells absorb all the visible wavelengths but each type of cone cell absorbs a different range;<br />rods are longer and thinner, cones have cone shape;<br />rod cells are principally used for dim light and night vision while cone cells require bright light / rods give poor visual acuity while cones give good visual acuity;<br />the pigment in rod cells is rhodopsin while in cone cells is iodopsin;<br />each individual cone cell is fed to a single (bipolar) neuron, whereas many rod cells synapse with a single (bipolar) neuron;</p>
