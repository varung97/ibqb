<div class='question'>
<p>DNA/RNA found in all living organisms/genetic code is universal;</p>
<p>amino acids all L- not D- isomers;</p>
<p>same 20 amino acids/proteins found in all living organisms;</p>
<p>involves comparing similarities and differences in the amino acid sequence of the same molecule;</p>
<p><em>e.g</em>. hemoglobin;</p>
<p>involves comparing base sequences of variable regions of DNA;</p>
<p><em>e.g</em>. mitochondrial DNA;</p>
<p>the more similar the base/amino acid sequence, the more closely related;</p>
<p>comparing amino acid sequences that result in the phenotype/comparing DNA sequences that result in the genotype;</p>
<p>evidence for molecular evolution in drug resistance;</p>
