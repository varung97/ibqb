<p>Which process is part of the mechanism that controls muscle contraction?</p>
<p>A. Troponin enables actin heads to attach to ATP and slide along myosin.<br />B. Myosin&nbsp;heads&nbsp;attach&nbsp;to&nbsp;troponin&nbsp;and&nbsp;tropomyosin&nbsp;pulls&nbsp;on&nbsp;actin&nbsp;filaments.<br />C. Tropomyosin attaches to calcium and breaks the bond between actin and myosin.<br />D. Calcium&nbsp;frees&nbsp;actin&nbsp;filaments&nbsp;for&nbsp;myosin&nbsp;heads&nbsp;to&nbsp;attach.</p>
