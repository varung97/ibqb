<p>pH changes;<br />raw sewage often contains pathogens that cause disease;<br />increase in nutrients/nitrates (from fertilizer) leads to eutrophication;<br />decomposition of organic matter releases ammonia into water;<br />ammonia is converted into nitrate;<br />nitrate causes algal bloom;<br />bacteria that feed on sewage cause high BOD/lack of (dissolved) oxygen;<br />lack of oxygen may kill fish/other aquatic life;<br />as algae release oxygen into water via photosynthesis, water recovers downstream;</p>
