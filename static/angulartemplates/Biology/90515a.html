<p>a. predator present causes <span style="text-decoration: underline;">both</span> to forage for less food;<br />b. fed black gobies showed little change in foraging (with predator present);<br />c. starved gobies foraged more than fed gobies (with predator present);<br />d. relative foraging remains similar between the two species / black goby always forages less than sand goby;</p>

<p>a. gobies may feed on smaller mud shrimps when predator present;<br />b. gobies may hide rather than forage when predator present / gobies may feed less efficiently if they are watching out for predators;<br />c. predator may also eat shrimp so less for gobies;<br />d. if predator eats gobies the total mass of food foraged is less / <em>OWTTE</em>;</p>
