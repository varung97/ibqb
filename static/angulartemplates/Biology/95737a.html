<p>DNA codes for a specific sequence of amino acids/polypeptide;<br />the DNA code for one polypeptide is a gene;<br />DNA is transcribed into mRNA;<br />mRNA moves to a ribosome;<br />where mRNA is translated into a polypeptide;<br />originally it was thought that one gene always codes for one polypeptide;<br />some genes do not code for a polypeptide;<br />some genes code for transfer RNA/tRNA/ribosomal RNA/rRNA;<br />some sections of DNA code for regulators that are not polypeptides;<br />antibody production does not follow this pattern (of simple transcription-translation); (<em>allow other examples</em>)<br />change in the gene/mutation will affect the primary structure of the polypeptide;</p>
