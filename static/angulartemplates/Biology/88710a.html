<p>a. (increase in) light (intensity) increases rate (of photosynthesis);<br />b. until a plateau is reached at higher light intensities/when another factor is limiting;<br />c. light needed for light dependent reactions/example of light dependent reaction;<br />d. (increase in) temperature/heat increases the rate (of photosynthesis);<br />e to an optimum temperature above which the rate drops;<br />f. temperature/heat affects rate of Calvin cycle/enzyme activity/rubisco activity;<br />g. (increase in) carbon dioxide (concentration) increases rate (of photosynthesis);<br />h. until a plateau is reached at higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels/when another factor is limiting;<br />i. CO<sub>2</sub> needed for light independent reactions/Calvin cycle/carboxylation of RuBP/production of glycerate phosphate;</p>
<p><em>If the candidate outlines more than two factors, only mark the first two.</em><br /><em>Accept the first two points relating to each factor if clearly shown on a graph with both axes appropriately labelled.</em><br /><em>Accept level instead of concentration, intensity or rate.</em><br /><em>Do not accept enzyme denaturation as a reason for reductions in photosynthesis at higher temperatures.</em></p>
