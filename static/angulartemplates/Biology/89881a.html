<p><em>Descriptions of properties expected not lists of properties.</em></p>
<p><em>hydrogen bonding:</em><br />a. high specific heat capacity requiring large amounts of energy to break the H-bonds/to raise the temperature;<br />b. boiling point is high/100&deg;C as H-bonds must be broken to change from liquid to gas;<br />c. cooling effect of evaporation due to H-bonds taking energy from liquid water to break / high latent heat of evaporation;<br />d. water molecules on surface resistant to forces because of surface tension;<br />e. water is most dense at 4&deg;C due to more regular hydrogen bonding;</p>
<p><em>polarity:</em><br />f. water molecules stick together through cohesion; (<em>full idea required</em>)<br />g. water molecules stick to other <span style="text-decoration: underline;">polar</span> molecules through adhesion; (<em>full idea required</em>)<br />h. good solvent of polar organic molecules</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. active transport of solutes from soil into roots;<br />b. draws water by osmosis<br />c. root hairs provide a large surface area for water uptake;<br />d. carried through xylem vessels;<br />e. transpiration is the loss of water (vapour) from leaves and stems / stomata;<br />f. (transpiration) creates suction/pull/negative pressure;<br />g. cellulose wall with rings of lignin give strength to resist (low) pressure;<br />h. water pulled up due to capillary action/cohesion/adhesion;<br />i. continuous column of molecules/transpiration stream;</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. water only plays a role in non-cyclic photophosphorylation;<br />b. chlorophyll absorbs light/photons and activates electrons of photosystem II;<br />c. excited/active electrons of photosystem II are passed to carriers;<br />d. photolysis is the splitting of water;<br />e. produces O<sub>2</sub> and H<sup>+</sup>/proton and electrons;<br />f. O<sub>2</sub> released (as waste);<br />g. electrons (from water) replace lost electrons in photosystem II;<br />h. electrons from photosystem II pass (through carriers) to photosystem I;<br />i. electrons from photosystem I pass to NADP<sup>+</sup> (in stroma);<br />j. NADP<sup>+</sup> accepts H<sup>+</sup>/proton (from water) to form NADPH;<br />k. electron flow causes protons pumped across thylakoid membranes/into the thylakoid space;<br />l. creating a proton concentration gradient;<br />m. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">chemiosmosis</span> couples electron transport to ATP synthesis;<br />n. protons pass through ATP synthase/synthetase;<br />o. NADPH/H<sup>+</sup>/proton is passed to the light-independent reactions (to fix carbon);</p>
