<div class='question_part_label'>a.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. body fat accumulation increased over time for all four groups;<br />b. fructose caused the (significantly) greatest accumulation of fat and water the least;</p>
<p><em>(both needed)</em><br />c. sucrose and artificial sweetener/diet soft drink had the same increase;<br />d. sucrose, artificial sweetener and water did not start accumulating fat until after 20 days while fructose increased from the beginning;</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>b.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. glucose-fed group has no/little increase in triglycerides while fructose-fed group has a (large) increase;<br />b. glucose-fed group has smaller variability than the fructose-fed group;<br />c. more triglycerides in fructose-fed group than glucose-fed group (from week 2 to week 10);</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>c.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. raised blood glucose/sugar levels/higher glucose in the urine;<br />b. decreased glycogen;<br />c. excess glucose will be converted to fat/increase obesity;<br />d. possibility of developing diabetes type II / late/adult onset diabetes; (<em>do not award this mark if answer refers to type 1 diabetes</em>)</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>d.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. glucose has a much greater range of uptake / <em>vice versa</em>;<br />b. but a (much) lower mean/uptake / <em>vice versa</em>;<br />c. there is no overlap (so there is clear evidence);</p>

<p>fructose</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>f.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. evidence that fructose causes (body) fat accumulation/obesity;<br />b. evidence that fructose is related to increased (blood) triglycerides which are correlated with obesity/coronary heart disease;<br />c. evidence that fructose is related to reduced insulin sensitivity/diabetes;<br />d. evidence that fructose is used in ribose synthesis but no clear evidence that fructose causes pancreatic cancer;</p>
