<p>wild-type enzyme has greater activity than the mutant enzymes</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>b.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. inhibitor is similar in shape/structure to malonyl-ACP which is a substrate of the reaction;</p>
<p>b. inhibitor is competing for the active site / competitive inhibition;</p>
<p>c. attaches to active site and does not let reaction occur;</p>
<p>d. if more substrate is added then the inhibition will be less;</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>c.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>a. activity of mutant enzymes without the inhibitor is always lower than wild-type;</p>
<p>b. activity of mutant enzymes with the inhibitor is always less than without;</p>
<p>c. but the differences are not as great as in the wild-type enzyme / the mutant enzymes were less sensitive to the inhibitor;</p>
<p>d. the activity of the mutant enzymes with the inhibitor are always higher than the activity of the wild-type enzyme with the inhibitor;</p>
<p>e. the data does not indicate whether these differences are significant or not / difference between wild-type enzyme and M1 enzyme not great;</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>d.</div>
