<p>digestion is the breakdown of large molecules into small molecules;<br />to allow diffusion / to make food soluble;<br />so foods can be absorbed into the bloodstream/body;<br />so foods can move from bloodstream into cells;<br />small molecules can be joined to form the organism&rsquo;s (unique) macromolecules;<br />hydrolysis is aided by enzymes;<br />hydrolysis requires water;<br />polysaccharides (hydrolysed) to disaccharides/monosaccharides/specific example;<br />proteins/polypeptides (hydrolysed) to amino acids;<br />fats/lipids/triglycerides (hydrolysed) to fatty acids and glycerol;</p>

<p>sunlight is the initial source of energy for (most) ecosystems;<br />sunlight (energy) is converted (through photosynthesis) into chemical/potential energy by producers/plants/autotrophs;<br />energy escapes from an ecosystem (as heat) / is not recycled;<br />flow of energy through an ecosystem can be represented as a pyramid of energy; (<em>allow a suitable diagram</em>)<br />energy flow in an ecosystem is measured as energy per unit area/volume, per unit time, for example kJ m<sup>&ndash;2</sup> yr<sup>&ndash;1</sup>/ kJ m<sup>&ndash;3</sup> day<sup>&ndash;1</sup> / other valid unit;<br />(chemical) energy is passed along the food chain/trophic levels;<br />primary consumer/herbivores obtain energy from plant food;<br />secondary/tertiary consumer/carnivores obtain energy by eating other (animals);<br />energy transfer between trophic levels is not 100 % efficient / is only about 10% efficient;<br />some energy is lost as heat through respiration;<br />decomposers obtain energy from waste products/dead bodies/leaf litter;</p>
