<div class='question'>
<p>&laquo;Sensory hair cells found in semicircular canals&raquo; detect movement of the head</p>
<p>Fluid in the canals lags behind movement of head<br /><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br />inertia of fluid makes it move more slowly than head</p>
<p>Fluid movement causes &ldquo;hairs&rdquo; of hair cells to bend</p>
<p>Bending of hairs causes nearby sensory neuron to conduct signal</p>
<p>Hairs in all three semicircular canals &laquo;which are at right angles so&raquo; detect head movement in any direction</p>
<p>Signals passed on to the nerve/brain</p>
