<p>a. decomposition of dead organic material «by saprotrophic bacteria» <br><br>b. «decomposition» leads to CO<sub>2</sub> formation/regeneration due to respiration </p>
<p>c. «saprotrophic bacteria only» partially decompose dead organic matter in acidic/anaerobic conditions in waterlogged soil </p>
<p>d. results in peat formation in bogs/swamps </p>
<p>e. photosynthetic bacteria/cyanobacteria fix CO<sub>2</sub> in photosynthesis</p>

<p>a. problem results from excessive use of antibiotics by doctors/veterinarians/in livestock<br><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br>low antibiotic doses taken by patients (not finishing treatment) <br><br>b. natural variation exists in any population of bacteria making some resistant to a specific antibiotic </p>
<p>c. variation arises from mutation<br><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br>antibiotic resistance can be transferred between bacteria by plasmids </p>
<p>d. antibiotic kills all bacteria except those that are resistant </p>
<p>e. resistant bacteria survive, reproduce and pass on resistance to offspring </p>
<p>f. soon population is made of mainly antibiotic resistant bacteria </p>
<p>g. this is an example of natural selection «increasing frequency of characteristics that make individuals better adapted to environment»</p>

<p>a. genetic modification carried out by gene transfer between species <br><br>b. genes transferred from one organism to another produce the same protein/amino acid sequence </p>
<p>c. due to universality of genetic code<br><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br>organisms use same codons of mRNA to code for specific amino acids </p>
<p>d. mRNA for required gene extracted/identified </p>
<p>e. DNA copies of mRNA made using reverse transcriptase </p>
<p>f. PCR used (to amplify DNA to be transferred) </p>
<p>g. genes/DNA transferred from one species to another using a vector </p>
<p>h. plasmid acts as vector to transfer genes to bacteria/<em>E. coli</em> </p>
<p>i. plasmid cut open at specific base sequences using restriction endonuclease<br><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br>plasmid cut to produce blunt ends then extra cytosine/C nucleotides added<br><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br>sticky ends made by adding extra guanine/G nucleotides<br><em><strong>OR</strong></em><br>mention of sticky ends if not gained already </p>
<p>j. cut plasmids mixed with DNA copies stick together (due to complementary base pairing) </p>
<p>k. DNA ligase makes sugar-phosphate bonds to link nucleotides of gene with those of plasmid </p>
<p>l. bacteria that take up plasmid are identified </p>
<p>m. (genetically modified) bacteria will reproduce carrying the transferred gene </p>
<p>n. example – <em>eg</em>: as production of human insulin using <em>E. coli</em> bacteria</p>
<p><em>Accept any of the points clearly explained in an annotated diagram</em>.</p>
