<p>a. skin/mucus membranes act as barrier (to pathogens);<br />b. sebaceous glands secrete lactic acid/fatty acids/sebum / make surface of skin acidic;<br />c. (skin/stomach) acid prevents growth of many pathogens;<br />d. lysozyme in mucus can kill bacteria;<br />e. pathogens caught in sticky mucus and removed from body;<br />f. inflammatory response/inflammation can cause swelling/redness/fever (to inhibit the pathogen);<br />g. phagocytes/macrophages/leucocytes/white blood cells (non-specifically) identify (pathogens/bacteria/fungi/viruses) as foreign;<br />h. (phagocytes macrophages/leucocytes/white blood cells) ingest pathogens;<br />i. specific lymphocytes recognize one specific antigen;<br />j. (antigen-specific) lymphocytes clone themselves;<br />k. lymphocytes/leucocytes produce antibodies;<br />l. antigen-antibody complex formed and stimulates destruction of pathogen;</p>

<p>a. antibiotics (are chemicals) used to treat bacterial diseases;<br />b. within populations, bacteria vary in their (genetic) resistance to antibiotics/fitness;<br />c. resistance arises by (random) gene mutation;<br />d. when antibiotics are used antibiotic-sensitive bacteria are killed;<br />e. (natural) selection favours those with resistance;<br />f. resistant bacteria survive, reproduce and spread the gene / increase allele frequency of resistant bacteria;<br />g. the more an antibiotic is used, the more bacterial resistance/the larger the population of antibiotic-resistant bacteria;<br />h. genes can be transferred to other bacteria by plasmids;<br />i. doctors/vets use different antibiotics but resistance develops to these as well;<br />j. multiple-antibiotic resistant bacteria evolve/it becomes difficult to treat some infections;</p>
