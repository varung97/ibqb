Except for the odd mistake in determining the value of <em>x</em> in part (b), many candidates scored full marks on the first two parts of the question.

Of those candidates who did answer in context, many scored 1 mark for &lsquo;had not visited Asia&rsquo; but a significant number used &lsquo;and&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;or&rsquo; and consequently were not awarded the other mark for expressing \(E \cup S\) in words. Whilst many correct answers of 20 were seen for part (d), a significant number of candidates wrote down the incorrect value of 113 which presumably was arrived at by evaluating \(n((E \cap S \cap A)')\) rather than the actual demand of the question.

Except for the odd mistake in determining the value of <em>x</em> in part (b), many candidates scored full marks on the first two parts of the question. Indeed, those who calculated an incorrect value of <em>x</em> were able to recover many of the marks in the remainder of the question with the use of follow through marks. &lsquo;Explain in words&hellip;&rsquo; required candidates to answer part (c) in the context of the question so &lsquo;<em>E </em>union <em>S </em>intersection not <em>A</em>&rsquo; earned no marks. Of those candidates who did answer in context, many scored 1 mark for &lsquo;had not visited Asia&rsquo; but a significant number used &lsquo;and&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;or&rsquo; and consequently were not awarded the other mark for expressing \(E \cup S\) in words. Whilst many correct answers of 20 were seen for part (d), a significant number of candidates wrote down the incorrect value of 113 which presumably was arrived at by evaluating \(n((E \cap S \cap A)')\) rather than the actual demand of the question. Having a Venn diagram seemed to be a good aid for parts (e) and (f) and much good work was seen in these two parts. However, in part (g), a significant number of candidates either chose a <span style="font: 19.0px Arial;">&ldquo;</span>with replacement<span style="font: 19.0px Arial;">&rdquo; </span>method or simply did not know what to do with the probabilities once they were found.
