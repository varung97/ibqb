<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">This question was well answered by the majority of the candidates. Most of the candidates were able to distinguish between the arithmetic and the geometric progression. A number of candidates worked out term by term by hand for which they needed more time than those that used the formulae to find the requested terms. Some of the students that found the terms the long way also lost a mark for premature rounding. It was pleasing to see how the last part of the question was answered using different methods. Those candidates that worked throughout the question using AP and GP formulae used either the solver or a graph to find the solution of the inequality. Those candidates that worked throughout the question in the long way also managed to compare the terms and find the correct year.</span></p>
