The first time she attempts the game, the probability of success is known&nbsp;to be 0.75. In subsequent attempts, if Kathy is successful, the difficulty increases and&nbsp;the probability of success is half the probability of success on the previous attempt.&nbsp;However, if she is unsuccessful, the probability of success remains the same. Kathy&nbsp;plays the game three times consecutively.</span></p>
