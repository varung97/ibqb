<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">In this question you may assume that these data are a random sample from a bivariate normal distribution, with population product moment correlation coefficient \(\rho \).</p>
<p class="p1">Richard wishes to do some research on two types of exams which are taken by a large number of students. He takes a random sample of the results of <span class="s1">10 </span>students, which are shown in the following table.</p>

<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">Using these data, it is decided to test, at the <span class="s1">1% </span>level, the null hypothesis \({H_0}:\rho &nbsp;= 0\) against the alternative hypothesis \({H_1}:\rho &nbsp;&gt; 0\).</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">Richard decides to take the exams himself. He scored <span class="s1">11 </span>on Exam 1 but his result on Exam 2 was lost.</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">Caroline believes that the population mean mark on Exam 2 is <span class="s1">6 </span>marks higher than the population mean mark on Exam 1. Using the original data from the <span class="s1">10 </span>students, it is decided to test, at the <span class="s1">5% </span>level, this hypothesis against the alternative hypothesis that the mean of the differences, \({\text{d}} = {\text{exam 2 mark }} - {\text{ exam 1 mark}}\), is less than <span class="s1">6 </span>marks.</p>
