<p class="p1">Two cyclists are at the same road intersection. One cyclist travels north at \(20\,{\text{km}}\,{{\text{h}}^{ - 1}}\). The other cyclist travels west at \(15\,{\text{km}}\,{{\text{h}}^{ - 1}}\).</p>
<p class="p1">Use calculus to show that the rate at which the distance between the two cyclists changes is independent of time.</p>
