<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">A fisherman notices that in any hour of fishing, he is equally likely to catch exactly&nbsp;two fish, as he is to catch less than two fish. Assuming the number of fish caught can&nbsp;be modelled by a Poisson distribution, calculate the expected value of the number of&nbsp;fish caught when he spends four hours fishing.</span></p>
