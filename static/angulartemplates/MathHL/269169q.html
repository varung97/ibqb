<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p>A smartphone&rsquo;s battery life is defined as the number of hours a fully charged battery can be used before the smartphone stops working. A company claims that the battery life of a model of smartphone is, on average, 9.5 hours. To test this claim, an experiment is conducted on a random sample of 20 smartphones of this model. For each smartphone, the battery life, \(b\)&nbsp;hours, is measured and the sample mean, \({\bar b}\), calculated. It can be assumed the battery lives are normally distributed with standard deviation 0.4 hours.</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p>It is then found that this model of smartphone has an average battery life of 9.8 hours.</p>

<p>Another model of smartphone whose battery life may be assumed to be normally distributed with mean <em>μ</em> hours and standard deviation 1.2 hours is tested. A researcher measures the battery life of six of these smartphones and calculates a confidence interval of [10.2, 11.4] for <em>μ</em>.</p>
<p>Calculate the confidence level of this interval.</p>
