<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p>Two species of plant,&nbsp;\(A\) and \(B\), are identical in appearance though it is known that the mean length of leaves from a plant of species&nbsp;\(A\) is&nbsp;\(5.2\) cm, whereas the mean length of leaves from a plant of species&nbsp;\(B\) is&nbsp;\(4.6\) cm. Both lengths can be modelled by normal distributions with standard deviation&nbsp;\(1.2\) cm.</p>
<p>In order to test whether a particular plant is from species&nbsp;\(A\) or species \(B\),&nbsp;\(16\) leaves are collected at random from the plant. The length, \(x\), of each leaf is measured and the mean length evaluated. A one-tailed test of the sample mean, \(\bar X\), is then performed at the&nbsp;\(5\% \) level, with the hypotheses: \({H_0}:\mu&nbsp; = 5.2\) and \({H_1}:\mu&nbsp; &lt; 5.2\).</p>
