<p class="p1">The diagram below shows a fenced triangular enclosure in the middle of a large grassy field. The points A and C are 3 m <span class="s1">apart. A goat \(G\) </span>is tied by a 5 m length of rope at point A on the outside edge of the enclosure.</p>
<p class="p1">Given that the corner of the enclosure at C <span class="s1">forms an angle of \(\theta \) </span>radians and the area of field that can be reached by the goat is \({\text{44 }}{{\text{m}}^{\text{2}}}\)<span class="s1">, find the value of \(\theta \).</span></p>
