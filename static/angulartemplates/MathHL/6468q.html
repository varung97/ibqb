<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 24.0px Helvetica;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Alan and Brian are athletes specializing in the long jump. When Alan jumps, the length of his jump is a normally distributed random variable with mean 5.2 metres and standard deviation 0.1 metres. When Brian jumps, the length of his jump is a normally distributed random variable with mean 5.1 metres and standard deviation 0.12 metres. For both athletes, the length of a jump is independent of the lengths of all other jumps. During a training session, Alan makes four jumps and Brian makes three jumps. Calculate the probability that the mean length of Alan&rsquo;s four jumps is less than the mean length of Brian&rsquo;s three jumps.</span></p>
