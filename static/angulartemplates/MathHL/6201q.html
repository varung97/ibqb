The results are summarised in the form \(\sum {x = 18} \) and \(\sum {{x^2} = 28.94} \). Before the spillage occurred the mean level of the chemical in the water was 1.1. Test at the 5 % significance level the hypothesis that there has been an increase in the amount of the chemical in the water.</span></p>

Assuming that this sample came from a normal population with variance 0.0256, find a 90 % confidence interval for the mean level of the chemical.</span></p>
