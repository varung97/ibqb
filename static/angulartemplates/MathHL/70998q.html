<div class='question'>
<p class="p1">A bicycle inner tube can be considered as a joined up cylinder of fixed length&nbsp;<span class="s1">\(200\) cm </span>and radius \(r\) cm. The radius \(r\) increases as the inner tube is pumped up. Air is being pumped into the inner tube so that the volume of air in the tube increases at a constant rate of \(30{\text{ c}}{{\text{m}}^3}{{\text{s}}^{ - 1}}\). Find the rate at which the radius of the inner tube is increasing when \(r = 2{\text{ cm}}\).</p>
