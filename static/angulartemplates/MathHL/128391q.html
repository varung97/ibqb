<p class="p1">An earth satellite moves in a path that can be described by the curve \(72.5{x^2} + 71.5{y^2} = 1\) where \(x = x(t)\) and \(y = y(t)\) are in thousands of kilometres and \(t\) is time in seconds.</p>
<p class="p1">Given that \(\frac{{{\text{d}}x}}{{{\text{d}}t}} = 7.75 \times {10^{ - 5}}\) when \(x = 3.2 \times {10^{ - 3}}\), find the possible values of \(\frac{{{\text{d}}y}}{{{\text{d}}t}}\).</p>
