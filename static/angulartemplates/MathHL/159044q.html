<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p>A teacher decides to use the marks obtained by a random sample of 12 students in Geography and History examinations to investigate whether or not there is a positive association between marks obtained by students in these two subjects. You may assume that the distribution of marks in the two subjects is bivariate normal.</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p>He gives the marks to Anne, one of his students, and asks her to use a calculator to carry out an appropriate test at the 5% significance level. Anne reports that the \(p\)-value is 0.177.</p>
</div>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;'>
<p>State suitable hypotheses for this investigation.</p>

<div class='question_part_label'>a.</div>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;'>
<p>State, in context, what conclusion should be drawn from this \(p\)-value.</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;'>
<p>The teacher then asks Anne for the values of the \(t\)-statistic and the product moment correlation coefficient \(r\) produced by the calculator but she has deleted these. Starting with the \(p\)-value, calculate these values of \(t\) and \(r\).</p>
