<div class='question'>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first game consists of one round. If Ying obtains more heads than Mario, she receives $5 from Mario. If Mario obtains more heads than Ying, he receives $10 from Ying. If they obtain the same number of heads, then Mario receives $2 from Ying. Determine Ying&rsquo;s expected winnings.</span></p>
