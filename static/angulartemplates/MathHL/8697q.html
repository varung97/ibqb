<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Testing has shown that the volume of drink in a bottle of mineral water filled by <strong>Machine A</strong> at a bottling plant is normally distributed with a mean of \(998\) ml and a standard deviation of \(2.5\) ml.</span></p>
</div>

<div class='question'>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Show that the probability that a randomly selected bottle filled by Machine A </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">contains more than \(1000\) ml of mineral water is \(0.212\).<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A random sample of \(5\) bottles is taken from Machine A. Find the probability that </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">exactly \(3\) of them each contain more than \(1000\) ml of mineral water.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Find the minimum number of bottles that would need to be sampled to ensure </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">that the probability of getting at least one bottle filled by Machine A containing </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">more than \(1000\) ml of mineral water, is greater than \(0.99\).<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been found that for <strong>Machine B</strong> the probability of a bottle containing less </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">than \(996\) ml of mineral water is \(0.1151\). The probability of a bottle containing </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">more than \(1000\) ml is \(0.3446\). Find the mean and standard deviation for the </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">volume of mineral water contained in bottles filled by Machine B.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The company that makes the mineral water receives, on average, m phone calls </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">every \(10\) minutes. The number of phone calls, \(X\) , follows a Poisson distribution </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">such that \({\text{P}}(X = 2) = {\text{P}}(X = 3) + {\text{P}}(X = 4)\) .</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Find the value of \(m\) .</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Find the probability that the company receives more than two telephone </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">calls in a randomly selected \(10\) minute period.</span></p>
