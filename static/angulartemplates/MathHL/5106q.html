<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Kathy plays a computer game in which she has to find the path through a maze within a&nbsp;certain time. The first time she attempts the game, the probability of success is known&nbsp;to be 0.75. In subsequent attempts, if Kathy is successful, the difficulty increases and&nbsp;the probability of success is half the probability of success on the previous attempt.&nbsp;However, if she is unsuccessful, the probability of success remains the same. Kathy&nbsp;plays the game three times consecutively.</span></p>
