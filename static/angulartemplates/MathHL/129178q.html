<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">Alun answers mathematics questions and checks his answer after doing each one.</p>
<p class="p1">The probability that he answers any question correctly is always \(\frac{6}{7}\), independently of all other questions. He will stop for coffee immediately following a second incorrect answer. Let \(X\) be the number of questions Alun answers before he stops for coffee.</p>

<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">Nic answers mathematics questions and checks his answer after doing each one.</p>
<p class="p1">The probability that he answers any question correctly is initially \(\frac{6}{7}\). After his first incorrect answer, Nic loses confidence in his own ability and from this point onwards, the probability that he answers any question correctly is now only \(\frac{4}{7}\).</p>
<p class="p1">Both before and after his first incorrect answer, the result of each question is independent of the result of any other question. Nic will also stop for coffee immediately following a second incorrect answer. Let \(Y\) be the number of questions Nic answers before he stops for coffee.</p>
