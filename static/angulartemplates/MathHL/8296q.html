<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">In a population of rabbits, \(1\%\) are known to have a particular disease. A test is developed for the disease that gives a positive result for a rabbit that <strong>does</strong> have the disease in \(99\%\) of cases. It is also known that the test gives a positive result for a rabbit that <strong>does not</strong> have the disease in \(0.1\%\) of cases. A rabbit is chosen at random from the population.</span></p>
