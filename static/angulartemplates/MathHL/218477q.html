<p>The function \(f\) is defined by</p>
<p>\[f(x) = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{l}} {{x^2} - 2,}&amp;{x &lt; 1} \\ {ax + b,}&amp;{x \geqslant 1} \end{array}} \right.\]</p>
<p>where \(a\) and \(b\) are real constants.</p>
<p>Given that both \(f\) and its derivative are continuous at \(x = 1\), find the value of \(a\) and the value of \(b\).</p>
