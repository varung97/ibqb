<p class="p1">Students sign up at a desk for an activity during the course of an afternoon. The arrival of each student is independent of the arrival of any other student and the number of students arriving per hour can be modelled as a Poisson distribution with a mean of \(\lambda \)<span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The desk is open for 4 hours. If exactly 5 people arrive to sign up for the activity during that time find the probability that exactly 3 <span class="s2">of them arrived during the first hour.</span></p>
