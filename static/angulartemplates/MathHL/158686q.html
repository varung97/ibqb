<p>John likes to go sailing every day in July. To help him make a decision on whether it is safe to go sailing he classifies each day in July as windy or calm. Given that a day in July is calm, the probability that the next day is calm is 0.9. Given that a day in July is windy, the probability that the next day is calm is 0.3. The weather forecast for the 1st July predicts that the probability that it will be calm is 0.8.</p>
