<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Port A is defined to be the origin of a set of coordinate axes and port B is located at the point (70, 30), where distances are measured in kilometres. A ship <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> sails from port A at 10:00 in a straight line such that its position \(t\) hours after 10:00 is given by \(r = t\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}<br />&nbsp; {10} \\ <br />&nbsp; {20} <br />\end{array}} \right)\)</span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">.</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">A speedboat <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> is capable of three times the speed of <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> and is to meet <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> by travelling the shortest possible distance. What is the latest time that <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> can leave port B?</span></p>
