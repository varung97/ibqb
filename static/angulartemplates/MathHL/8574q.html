<div class='question'>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Bob measured the heights of 63 students. After analysis, he conjectured that the height, \(H\) , of the students could be modelled by a normal distribution with mean 166.5 cm and standard deviation 5 cm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on this assumption, estimate the number of these students whose height is at least 170 cm.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Later Bob noticed that the tape he had used to measure the heights was faulty as it started at the 5 cm mark and not at the zero mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the correct values of the mean and variance of the distribution of the heights of these students?</span></p>
