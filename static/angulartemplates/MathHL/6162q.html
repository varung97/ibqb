The only restriction is that all tables must seat the same number of guests and each table must have more than one guest. There are fewer than 350 guests, but they have forgotten the exact number. However they remember that when they try to seat them with two at each table there is one guest left over. The same happens with tables of 3, 4, 5 and 6 guests. When there were 7 guests per table there were none left over. Find the number of guests.</span></p>
