Experimental data showed that 67 % of the individuals using <em>SLIM3M</em> lost up to five kilograms and 12.4 % lost at least seven kilograms. Assuming that X follows a normal distribution, find the expected weight loss of a person who follows the <em>SLIM3M</em> regime for three months.</span></p>
