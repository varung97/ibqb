<p class="p1">Farmer Suzie grows turnips and the weights of her turnips are normally distributed with a mean of \(122g\) and standard deviation of \(14.7g\).</p>
<p class="p1">(i) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>Calculate the percentage of Suzie&rsquo;s turnips that weigh between&nbsp;\(110g\) and \(130g\).</p>
<p class="p1">(ii) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>Suzie has&nbsp;<span class="s1">\(100\) </span>turnips to take to market. Find the expected number weighing more than \(130g\).</p>

<p class="p1">Farmer Ray also grows turnips and the weights of his turnips are normally distributed with a mean of \(144g\). Ray only takes to market turnips that weigh more than \(130g\). Over a period of time, Ray finds he has to reject&nbsp;\(1\) in&nbsp;\(15\) turnips due to their being underweight.</p>
<p class="p1">(i) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>Find the standard deviation of the weights of Ray&rsquo;s turnips.</p>
<p class="p1">(ii) <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>Ray has \(200\) turnips to take to market. Find the expected number weighing more than \(150g\).</p>
