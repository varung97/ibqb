<p class="p1">In a particular company, it is claimed that the distance travelled by employees to work is independent of their salary. To test this, 20 randomly selected employees are asked about the distance they travel to work and the size of their salaries. It is found that the product moment correlation coefficient, \(r\), for the sample is \( - 0.35\).</p>
<p class="p1">You may assume that both salary and distance travelled to work follow normal distributions.</p>
<p class="p1">Perform a one-tailed test at the&nbsp;\(5\% \) significance level to test whether or not the distance travelled to work and the salaries of the employees are independent.</p>
