<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">Andy and Roger are playing tennis with the rule that if one of them wins a game when serving then he carries on serving, and if he loses then the other player takes over the serve.</p>
<p class="p1">The probability Andy wins a game when serving is \(\frac{1}{2}\) and the probability he wins a game when not serving is \(\frac{1}{4}\). Andy serves in the first game. Let \({u_n}\) denote the probability that Andy wins the \({n^{{\text{th}}}}\) game.</p>
