<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">A competition consists of two independent events, shooting at 100 <span class="s1">targets and running for one hour.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The number of targets a contestant hits is the \(S\) score. The \(S\) <span class="s2">scores are normally distributed with mean 65 and standard deviation 10</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">Contestants are disqualified if their \(S\) <span class="s1">score is less than 50 </span><strong>and </strong>their \(R\) score is less than \(x\) <span class="s1">km</span>.</p>
