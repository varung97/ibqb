<h2 style='margin-top: 1em'>Examiners report</h2>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>Candidates are often pleased to be able to demonstrate their knowledge of heart structure and many were able to do so successfully here. The commonest errors were to misrepresent the relative sizes of the atria and ventricles, or relative thickness of the walls of the four chambers. Weaker candidates were confused about the connections of vessels to chambers, with vessels connected to the wrong chamber or to the muscle in the wall, rather than the lumen through which blood flows. There were some truly impressive diagrams that were a pleasure to mark and a demonstration of the quality of many of this year&rsquo;s generation of IB biology candidates.</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>a.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>The requirement was only to give an outline of the process of blood clotting. Some candidates gave far more detail than this and had already scored six marks in the first paragraph of their answer. The most frequent errors were to state that thrombin is converted to prothrombin or fibrin to fibrinogen. A point that might be stressed more in teaching is how clot formation is localised in a cut or other wound. The mechanism described by some candidates would lead to clotting throughout the blood system!</p>
<div class='question_part_label'>b.</div>
</div>
<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>The last part of this question proved problematic for many candidates. There was no difficulty in giving enough benefits of vaccination. The problem came with finding enough genuine risks. Many of the answers given by candidates were simply untrue or were so unlikely that they should not be taught as risks or dangers of vaccination. There are of course some mild and temporary side effects at the site of the vaccination and rare allergic reactions. Also, some vaccinations have to be repeated or booster shots are necessary. There were dangerous misunderstandings in some candidates&rsquo; answers, for example that there is a significant risk of actually contracting the disease from the vaccine or that multiple vaccines weaken the immune system. Some answers were not risks of the actual process of vaccination, for example its unaffordability in poorer countries, the fact that used hypodermic needles could spread disease, or that there are irrational fears about particular vaccines. Risks of vaccination are so much fewer and less significant than benefits that risks should probably not be included in future versions of the IB Biology programme. To be fair to candidates, it was challenge to express more than one or two risks in a way that was accepted by examiners, so part (c) was more discriminating than teachers commenting on G2 forms expected. One teacher commented that 8 marks was too much for this question and in retrospect this is possibly true.</p>
