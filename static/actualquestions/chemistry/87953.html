<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p>A class studied the equilibrium established when ethanoic acid and ethanol react together in the presence of a strong acid, using propanone as an inert solvent. The equation is given below.</p>
<p>\[{\text{C}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{3}}}{\text{COOH}} + {{\text{C}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{5}}}{\text{OH}} \rightleftharpoons {\text{C}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{3}}}{\text{COO}}{{\text{C}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{5}}} + {{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O}}\]</p>

<p>Generally candidates found some elements of this question quite challenging but there were accessible marks of even the weakest candidates. The majority of students were able to determine the molar mass of ethanoic acid but some struggled to calculate the mass from the volume. Most candidates were able to identify the role of hydrochloric acid as a catalyst but some struggled to identify the liquid whose volume had the greatest uncertainty. Most candidates were able to calculate the absolute uncertainty of the titre but some lost a mark by omitting the \( + \)/\( - \) sign. Candidates did not identify the first titre as incongruent and simply averaged the three values which perhaps suggests limited experimental experience. Most students could determine an equilibrium constant expression, but many did not answer the question in (g) and did not suggest how the equilibrium could be established experimentally with many referring to the equal rate of the forward and backward reaction. Many candidates were aware of Le Chatelier effects on the position of equilibrium, but a significant number failed to use this information to answer the question asked and could not explain the small effect of temperature changes. Whilst most students managed to identify the ester as the component of the mixture that was insoluble in water, many did not refer to its inability to form strong hydrogen bonds to water which was necessary for the mark. Quite a number of students came up with a valid reason why water would not be a suitable though some students appeared to have overlooked that the question asked for &ldquo;one other reason&rdquo; than that implied in (j).</p>

Most candidates were able to identify the role of hydrochloric acid as a catalyst but some struggled to identify the liquid whose volume had the greatest uncertainty. Most candidates were able to calculate the absolute uncertainty of the titre but some lost a mark by omitting the \( + \)/\( - \) sign. Candidates did not identify the first titre as incongruent and simply averaged the three values which perhaps suggests limited experimental experience. Most students could determine an equilibrium constant expression, but many did not answer the question in (g) and did not suggest how the equilibrium could be established experimentally with many referring to the equal rate of the forward and backward reaction. Many candidates were aware of Le Chatelier effects on the position of equilibrium, but a significant number failed to use this information to answer the question asked and could not explain the small effect of temperature changes. Whilst most students managed to identify the ester as the component of the mixture that was insoluble in water, many did not refer to its inability to form strong hydrogen bonds to water which was necessary for the mark. Quite a number of students came up with a valid reason why water would not be a suitable though some students appeared to have overlooked that the question asked for &ldquo;one other reason&rdquo; than that implied in (j).</p>
