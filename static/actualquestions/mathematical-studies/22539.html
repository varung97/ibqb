There was a lot of reading in this question and some candidates seemed to lose their way as their solution developed and, as a consequence, lost marks in the latter part of the question. A significant number of candidates obtained nearly full marks for parts (a) through to (d). The marks which tended to not be awarded were not giving the required answer to two decimal places and not adding the amount invested onto the interest earned in part (c). Indeed, many candidates were able to correctly determine the depreciated value of the car on \({1^{{\text{st}}}}\) August 2009 by simply finding 91% of the original price. However, part (e) proved to be elusive for many candidates as some simply treated the problem as a &lsquo;reverse simple interest problem&rsquo; and subtracted 9% for each of a further 3 years. As a consequence, erroneous answers of the form 17,361.60, from \(\left( {27127.50 \times (1 - 0.09 \times 4)} \right)\), were often conveniently ignored and rounded to the required answer of 18,600&nbsp;GBP. Such a method earned no marks at all. There was a lot of information given in the stem to the last part of the question and, as a consequence, many candidates were unable to achieve full marks here. There was certainly a great deal of confusion as to what to divide by 0.8694 (seeing \(\frac{{18\,600 + 8198.05 - 30\,500}}{{0.86944}} =&nbsp; - 4258.05\) was not uncommon) and even introducing the original exchange rate of 0.7234 caused confusion. As a further example, an incorrect value carried forward from part (c) (1,250.55) led to a negative result. Provided the method was correct (despite an incorrect value carried forward), the three method marks were awarded. However, the negative result of &ndash;7,667.53 should have flagged to the candidate that something was wrong somewhere and this could only be in the current part of the question or part (c).</span></p>
