<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 19.0px Helvetica;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Surprisingly, a correct method for substituting the value of &ndash;2 into the given function led many candidates to a variety of incorrect answers. This suggests a poor handling of negative signs and/or poor use of the graphic display calculator. Many correct answers were seen in part (b) as candidates seemed to be well-drilled in the process of differentiation. Part (c), however, proved to be quite a discriminator. There were 5 marks for this part of the question and simply showing that \(x - 3\) is a turning point was not sufficient for all of these marks. Many simply scored only two marks by substituting \(x - 3\) into their answer to part (b). Once they had shown that there was a turning point at \(x - 3\), candidates were not expected to use the second derivative but to show that the function decreases for \(x &lt; 3\) and increases for \(x &gt; 3\). Part (d) required a sketch which could have either been done on lined paper or on graph paper. The majority of candidates obtained at least two marks here with the most common errors seen being incomplete labelled axes and curves which were far from being smooth. In part (e), many candidates identified the correct coordinates for the two marks available. But for many candidates, this is where responses stopped as, in part (f), connecting the gradient function found in part (b) to the given coordinates proved problematic and only a significant minority of candidates were able to arrive at the required answer of &ndash;24. Indeed, there were many NR (no responses) to this part and the final part of the question. As many candidates found part (f) difficult, even more candidates found getting beyond the gradient of <em>L</em> very difficult indeed. A minority of candidates wrote down the gradient of their perpendicular but then did not seem to know where to proceed from there. Substituting their gradient for <em>b</em> and the coordinates (2,&nbsp;&ndash;12) into the equation \(x + by + c = 0\) was a popular, but erroneous, method. It was a rare event indeed to see a script with a correct answer for this part of the question.</span></p>

In part (e), many candidates identified the correct coordinates for the two marks available. But for many candidates, this is where responses stopped as, in part (f), connecting the gradient function found in part (b) to the given coordinates proved problematic and only a significant minority of candidates were able to arrive at the required answer of &ndash;24. Indeed, there were many NR (no responses) to this part and the final part of the question. As many candidates found part (f) difficult, even more candidates found getting beyond the gradient of <em>L</em> very difficult indeed. A minority of candidates wrote down the gradient of their perpendicular but then did not seem to know where to proceed from there. Substituting their gradient for <em>b</em> and the coordinates (2,&nbsp;&ndash;12) into the equation \(x + by + c = 0\) was a popular, but erroneous, method.

This suggests a poor handling of negative signs and/or poor use of the graphic display calculator. Many correct answers were seen in part (b) as candidates seemed to be well-drilled in the process of differentiation. Part (c), however, proved to be quite a discriminator. There were 5 marks for this part of the question and simply showing that \(x - 3\) is a turning point was not sufficient for all of these marks. Many simply scored only two marks by substituting \(x - 3\) into their answer to part (b). Once they had shown that there was a turning point at \(x - 3\), candidates were not expected to use the second derivative but to show that the function decreases for \(x &lt; 3\) and increases for \(x &gt; 3\). Part (d) required a sketch which could have either been done on lined paper or on graph paper. The majority of candidates obtained at least two marks here with the most common errors seen being incomplete labelled axes and curves which were far from being smooth.
