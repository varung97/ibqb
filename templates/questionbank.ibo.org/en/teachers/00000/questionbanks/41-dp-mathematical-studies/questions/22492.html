Whilst many candidates realized that the line of regression passes through the point <em>M</em>, a significant number of candidates seemed to draw their line &lsquo;by eye&rsquo; rather than using the equation found in part (d) and, as a consequence for many, their straight line (or projected line) did not fall within the required tolerances for the second mark. Many candidates understood the requirements for part (f) and full marks were seen on a majority of scripts. Those candidates, however, who used their graph instead scored, at most, two marks here. Many candidates seemed to be well-drilled in giving a suitable reason in part (f) and &lsquo;within the data range&rsquo; or a &lsquo;strong correlation&rsquo; were frequently seen. Percentage error caused very few problems for candidates and many correct answers were seen in part (h).</span></p>

Many good and accurate attempts at plotting a scatter diagram were seen in part (a). However, a minority of candidates chose not to use graph paper but instead used their answer book. These candidates achieved, at most, one mark for that part question. Many correct answers were seen in parts (b) and (d) reflecting good use of the graphic display calculator.
