<p>Probably the least popular option. The drawing of the diagram of chloromethane was generally excellent, as was the prediction/recall of the shape and bond angle. With the reasons for polarity, the concept of bond polarity was well understood, but the idea of asymmetry resulting in a dipole was less clearly appreciated. The construction of the chemical equation was disappointing, as was the description of the three types of bonding, very often missing the important point, in that they are attractions. With the calculation of volume of hydrogen, it was quite rare to get a fully correct answer. The biggest error was to use an incorrect value for the number of moles of hydrogen in the equation \(pV = nRT\), by failing to halve the moles of hydrogen. The use of \(pV = nRT\) also caused problems with units. The acid base nature of oxides of a period were generally well known. In contrast, the construction or recall of correct chemical equations for the reaction with water was a weakness.</p>
