<p>In Part (a) most candidates gained full marks, with the most common error being a failure to quote the answer to the precision specified, but the explanations of deflection, and more particularly detection, in the mass spectrometer were weak. The prediction of relative atomic radii of the isotopes, something that required the application of reason rather than recall, also proved much more challenging. Part (b) revealed that many candidates have a very weak understanding of the metallic bond with many thinking the bonding was ionic.</p>
<p>Even when they knew about a cation lattice and delocalized electrons, a mark was frequently dropped by failing to specify that the attraction between them was electrostatic. Most candidates wrote the correct equation in Part (c), but it is still disturbing that some students at this level cannot write even the most straightforward chemical equation. In Part (d) many students proved capable of carrying out routine stoichiometric calculations to identify the limiting reactant and use the result to find the mass of the product.</p>
<p>Even if the final result was incorrect quite frequently students gained some credit through the application of ECF. Only the better candidates could write an equation for the neutralisation of phosphoric(V) acid and even the routine derivation of a conjugate base from the formula of the acid proved difficult for many. In Part (e) most students could manage the correct Lewis structure, though some lost the mark through omitting the charge. Many candidates also scored well on the shape of the ion and the polarity of the P-H bond.</p>

<p>Even when they knew about a cation lattice and delocalized electrons, a mark was frequently dropped by failing to specify that the attraction between them was electrostatic. Most candidates wrote the correct equation in Part (c), but it is still disturbing that some students at this level cannot write even the most straightforward chemical equation. In Part (d) many students proved capable of carrying out routine stoichiometric calculations to identify the limiting reactant and use the result to find the mass of the product.</p>
<p>Even if the final result was incorrect quite frequently students gained some credit through the application of ECF. Only the better candidates could write an equation for the neutralisation of phosphoric(V) acid and even the routine derivation of a conjugate base from the formula of the acid proved difficult for many. In Part (e) most students could manage the correct Lewis structure, though some lost the mark through omitting the charge. Many candidates also scored well on the shape of the ion and the polarity of the P-H bond.</p>
