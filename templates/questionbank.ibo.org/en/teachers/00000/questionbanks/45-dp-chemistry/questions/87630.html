<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p>A class studied the equilibrium established when ethanoic acid and ethanol react together in the presence of a strong acid, using propanone as an inert solvent. The equation is given below.</p>
<p>\[{\text{C}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{3}}}{\text{COOH}} + {{\text{C}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{5}}}{\text{OH}} \rightleftharpoons {\text{C}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{3}}}{\text{COO}}{{\text{C}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{5}}} + {{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O}}\]</p>

<div class='specification'>
<p>After one week, a \(5.00 \pm 0.05{\text{ c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) sample of the final equilibrium mixture was pipetted out and titrated with \({\text{0.200 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) aqueous sodium hydroxide to determine the amount of ethanoic acid remaining. The following titration results were obtained:</p>

<p>Generally candidates found this question quite challenging and some left quite a number of parts unanswered. The tradition is that the first question on the paper is a data response question, which often addresses many aspects of the syllabus, and unfortunately candidates, especially those of average or below average ability, seem to have difficulty in tackling questions of this nature. One other issue with data response questions is that, of necessity, the data appears at the beginning of the question whilst, mainly because of the space left for candidates to answer, the later parts of the question referring to these data may not appear until a number of pages into the paper.</p>
<p>Part (a) concerning density, volume and amount of substance was generally reasonably well answered, but the following parts, concerning uncertainties, were rarely answered correctly and a number confused precision (uncertainty, either absolute or as a percentage) and accuracy (percentage error in the value obtained). Many candidates also seemed to lack experimental common sense, simply taking an average that included an initial titre that was much larger than the concordant second and third titres, rather than excluding it. This lack of experimental &ldquo;know how&rdquo; was also evident in responses to (c) (iii) where it was unusual for the approach to the question to indicate the candidate had realised that the alkali was neutralising two different acids (HCl and \({\text{C}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{3}}}{\text{COOH}}\)) and again in part (d) where it was rare for the response to outline a practical solution to the problem, though quite a number of candidates suggested that the pH would become constant, presumably not realising that the pH would be dominated by the HCl catalyst. Most students could however carry out the more routine tasks of writing an equilibrium constant expression and determining its value from the data given. Many candidates were aware of Le Chatelier effects on the position of equilibrium, but a significant number failed to use this information to answer the question actually asked and the unusual approach to the effect of temperature disconcerted many. Whilst most students managed to identify the ester as the component of the mixture that was insoluble in water, the reasons given were usually couched in terms of the polarity of the molecule (many quite polar molecules, halogenoalkanes for example, are insoluble in water) rather than its inability to form strong hydrogen bonds to water, which is the critical factor. Quite a number of students came up with a valid reason why water would not be a suitable solvent, though some students appeared to have overlooked the fact the question stated &ldquo;other reason&rdquo;.</p>

This lack of experimental &ldquo;know how&rdquo; was also evident in responses to (c) (iii) where it was unusual for the approach to the question to indicate the candidate had realised that the alkali was neutralising two different acids (HCl and \({\text{C}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{3}}}{\text{COOH}}\)) and again in part (d) where it was rare for the response to outline a practical solution to the problem, though quite a number of candidates suggested that the pH would become constant, presumably not realising that the pH would be dominated by the HCl catalyst. Most students could however carry out the more routine tasks of writing an equilibrium constant expression and determining its value from the data given. Many candidates were aware of Le Chatelier effects on the position of equilibrium, but a significant number failed to use this information to answer the question actually asked and the unusual approach to the effect of temperature disconcerted many. Whilst most students managed to identify the ester as the component of the mixture that was insoluble in water, the reasons given were usually couched in terms of the polarity of the molecule (many quite polar molecules, halogenoalkanes for example, are insoluble in water) rather than its inability to form strong hydrogen bonds to water, which is the critical factor. Quite a number of students came up with a valid reason why water would not be a suitable solvent, though some students appeared to have overlooked the fact the question stated &ldquo;other reason&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Generally candidates found this question quite challenging and some left quite a number of parts unanswered. The tradition is that the first question on the paper is a data response question, which often addresses many aspects of the syllabus, and unfortunately candidates, especially those of average or below average ability, seem to have difficulty in tackling questions of this nature. One other issue with data response questions is that, of necessity, the data appears at the beginning of the question whilst, mainly because of the space left for candidates to answer, the later parts of the question referring to these data may not appear until a number of pages into the paper.</p>
<p>Part (a) concerning density, volume and amount of substance was generally reasonably well answered, but the following parts, concerning uncertainties, were rarely answered correctly and a number confused precision (uncertainty, either absolute or as a percentage) and accuracy (percentage error in the value obtained).
