<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p>2-methylbutan-2-ol, \({{\text{(C}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{3}}}{\text{)}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{C(OH)C}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{C}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{3}}}\), is a liquid with a smell of camphor that was formerly used as a sedative. One way of producing it starts with 2-methylbut-2-ene.</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p>As well as 2-methylbutan-2-ol, the reaction also produces a small quantity of an optically active isomer, <strong>X</strong>.</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p>2-methylbutan-2-ol can also be produced by the hydrolysis of 2-chloro-2-methylbutane, \({{\text{(C}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{3}}}{\text{)}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{CCl}}{{\text{C}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{5}}}\), with aqueous sodium hydroxide.</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p>2-chloro-2-methylbutane contains some molecules with a molar mass of approximately \({\text{106 g}}\,{\text{mo}}{{\text{l}}^{ - 1}}\) and some with a molar mass of approximately \({\text{108 g}}\,{\text{mo}}{{\text{l}}^{ - 1}}\).</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p>2-chloro-2-methylbutane can also be converted into compound <strong>Z</strong> by a two-stage reaction via compound <strong>Y</strong>:</p>

<p>Many students could recall the reagents for the hydration of an alkene and recognize the alcohol as a tertiary alcohol that would not undergo oxidation. Statements regarding optical activity often lacked precision and betrayed confusion with chirality. Very few could correctly describe how a polarimeter worked, especially the second rotating sheet of polaroid, and students frequently drew the structure of 2-methylbutan-2-ol rather than its chiral isomer. Most students stated that the alcohol was more polar than the alkene, but fewer mentioned that it could form hydrogen bonds to water and even less linked this to the presence of the hydroxyl group. Almost all students recognized that the hydrolysis was \({{\text{S}}_{\text{N}}}{\text{1}}\), with an encouraging number being able to write reasonable mechanisms, though many still lost marks through a lack of precision in where their curly arrows started and ended. Many candidates also stated an appropriate rate equation along with the units of the rate constant. Very few students linked the difference of two molar mass units to the presence in the molecule of chlorine, with its naturally occurring isotopes, and the discussion of any effect on the hydrolysis rate often revealed a lack of clear thinking. In contrast many students correctly identified the nitrile as the intermediate in the chain extension reaction and reagents for its formation and hydrogenation were generally well known.</p>

Very few could correctly describe how a polarimeter worked, especially the second rotating sheet of polaroid, and students frequently drew the structure of 2-methylbutan-2-ol rather than its chiral isomer. Most students stated that the alcohol was more polar than the alkene, but fewer mentioned that it could form hydrogen bonds to water and even less linked this to the presence of the hydroxyl group. Almost all students recognized that the hydrolysis was \({{\text{S}}_{\text{N}}}{\text{1}}\), with an encouraging number being able to write reasonable mechanisms, though many still lost marks through a lack of precision in where their curly arrows started and ended. Many candidates also stated an appropriate rate equation along with the units of the rate constant. Very few students linked the difference of two molar mass units to the presence in the molecule of chlorine, with its naturally occurring isotopes, and the discussion of any effect on the hydrolysis rate often revealed a lack of clear thinking. In contrast many students correctly identified the nitrile as the intermediate in the chain extension reaction and reagents for its formation and hydrogenation were generally well known.</p>
