<p>Probably the most popular and successfully answered. Most students were family with IUPAC nomenclature and realised that UV radiation is required to initiate the halogenation of an alkane, though fewer realised that the much greater probability of forming a different isomer, or the problem of polysubstitution would result in a very low yield. The conditions for the hydrolysis of the bromoalkane were well known, though fewer recognised it as a tertiary halogenoalkane and described the \({{\text{S}}_{\text{N}}}{\text{1}}\) reaction mechanism. Only a small number of candidates were able to show the electron pair originating from C&ndash;Br bond or the lone pair on the oxygen or negative charge of the hydroxide ion. Many candidates knew that tertiary alcohols could not be oxidised and correctly drew primary structures for alcohols that could be oxidised to carboxylic acids although some made careless errors and drew secondary structures or did not answer the question and proposed aldehydes. Many candidates were able to determine the enthalpy change, from bond enthalpies but some had not read the question carefully and did not address the final mark. A significant number of candidates made small errors but still gained ECF marks as they had set their working out clearly. The calculation of the amount of fuel required to raise the temperature proved more difficult with many students overlooking the volume of water and using the data to calculate the mass of the hydrocarbon that would be heated by 80 &deg;C by the molar enthalpy of combustion and using the specific heat capacity of water.</p>

<p>Probably the most popular and successfully answered. Most students were family with IUPAC nomenclature and realised that UV radiation is required to initiate the halogenation of an alkane, though fewer realised that the much greater probability of forming a different isomer, or the problem of polysubstitution would result in a very low yield. The conditions for the hydrolysis of the bromoalkane were well known, though fewer recognised it as a tertiary halogenoalkane and described the \({{\text{S}}_{\text{N}}}{\text{1}}\) reaction mechanism. Only a small number of candidates were able to show the electron pair originating from C&ndash;Br bond or the lone pair on the oxygen or negative charge of the hydroxide ion. Many candidates knew that tertiary alcohols could not be oxidised and correctly drew primary structures for alcohols that could be oxidised to carboxylic acids although some made careless errors and drew secondary structures or did not answer the question and proposed aldehydes. Many candidates were able to determine the enthalpy change, from bond enthalpies but some had not read the question carefully and did not address the final mark. A significant number of candidates made small errors but still gained ECF marks as they had set their working out clearly. The calculation of the amount of fuel required to raise the temperature proved more difficult with many students overlooking the volume of water and using the data to calculate the mass of the hydrocarbon that would be heated by 80 &deg;C by the molar enthalpy of combustion and using the specific heat capacity of water.</p>
