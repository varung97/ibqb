<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p>Two chemistry students wished to determine the enthalpy of hydration of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. They measured the initial and the highest temperature reached when anhydrous magnesium sulfate, \({\text{MgS}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{4}}}{\text{(s)}}\), was dissolved in water. They presented their results in the table below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../../../../../../ib-questionbank-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/tinymce_asset/asset/1570/Schermafbeelding_2016-08-11_om_16.47.13.png" alt="M14/4/CHEMI/HP2/ENG/TZ1/01.a" /></p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p>The students repeated the experiment using 6.16 g of solid hydrated magnesium sulfate, \({\text{MgS}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{4}}} \bullet {\text{7}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O(s)}}\), and \({\text{50.0 c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of water. They found the enthalpy change, \(\Delta {H_2}\) , to be \( + {\text{18 kJ}}\,{\text{mo}}{{\text{l}}^{ - 1}}\).</p>
<p>The enthalpy of hydration of solid anhydrous magnesium sulfate is difficult to determine experimentally, but can be determined using the diagram below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../../../../../../ib-questionbank-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/tinymce_asset/asset/1572/Schermafbeelding_2016-08-11_om_17.02.53.png" alt="M14/4/CHEMI/HP2/ENG/TZ1/01.b" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) &nbsp; &nbsp; The literature value for the enthalpy of hydration of anhydrous magnesium sulfate is \( - 103{\text{ kJ}}\,{\text{mo}}{{\text{l}}^{ - 1}}\). Calculate the percentage difference between the literature value and the value determined from experimental results, giving your answer to <strong>one </strong>decimal place. (If you did not obtain an answer for the experimental value in (b)(i) then use the value of \( - 100{\text{ kJ}}\,{\text{mo}}{{\text{l}}^{ - 1}}\), but this is <strong>not </strong>the correct value.)</p>
