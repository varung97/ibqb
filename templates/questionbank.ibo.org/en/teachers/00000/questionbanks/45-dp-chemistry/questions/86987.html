<p class="p1">Most candidates were able to draw an arrow in the box diagram for the electron configuration of chromium, but few gave a complete description of the nature of metallic bonding and did not refer to the attraction between the \({\text{C}}{{\text{r}}^{3 + }}\) cations and the delocalized electrons. Candidates were more successful in explaining malleability in terms of \({\text{C}}{{\text{r}}^{3 + }}\) cations sliding over one another. Most candidates were able to use oxidation numbers in naming \({\text{C}}{{\text{r}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{3}}}\) but the explanation of ionic bonding was incomplete with only limited reference to the electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged ions. Students continue to struggle to understand that conductivity of molten ionic compounds is due to mobile ions not electrons. Most candidates were able to deduce the oxidation number in the complex ion and give the answer using the correct notation. The nature of the ligand-chromium bond was well known and the explanation of the colour of transition metal complexes was stronger than in previous sessions with only a minority referring to the emission of light. Some teachers have commented that trans/cis-isomers of the complex ions is not specifically stated in the guide but many students were able draw two possible isomers. The representation of 3D structures could have been clearer although this was not explicitly penalized. Redox half-reactions continue to challenge many with only the stronger students being able to gain both marks and deduce the correct overall equation. Some teachers commented that the question was too demanding as students had to construct two half-equations in order to get to the overall redox equation, but the \({\text{C}}{{\text{r}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O}}_{\text{7}}^{{\text{2}} - }{\text{/C}}{{\text{r}}^{3 + }}\) half-reaction is given in table 14 of the current data booklet. The majority of candidates identified the conversion of \({{\text{I}}^ - }\) to \({\text{I}}{{\text{O}}^{3 - }}\) as oxidation and many able to identify the increase in oxidation number. The workings of a voltaic cell was generally well understood but the definition of the term standard electrode potential was often incomplete with the reference to standard conditions of the hydrogen electrode often missing.</p>

<p class="p1">Most candidates were able to draw an arrow in the box diagram for the electron configuration of chromium, but few gave a complete description of the nature of metallic bonding and did not refer to the attraction between the \({\text{C}}{{\text{r}}^{3 + }}\) cations and the delocalized electrons. Candidates were more successful in explaining malleability in terms of \({\text{C}}{{\text{r}}^{3 + }}\) cations sliding over one another. Most candidates were able to use oxidation numbers in naming \({\text{C}}{{\text{r}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{3}}}\) but the explanation of ionic bonding was incomplete with only limited reference to the electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged ions. Students continue to struggle to understand that conductivity of molten ionic compounds is due to mobile ions not electrons. Most candidates were able to deduce the oxidation number in the complex ion and give the answer using the correct notation. The nature of the ligand-chromium bond was well known and the explanation of the colour of transition metal complexes was stronger than in previous sessions with only a minority referring to the emission of light. Some teachers have commented that trans/cis-isomers of the complex ions is not specifically stated in the guide but many students were able draw two possible isomers. The representation of 3D structures could have been clearer although this was not explicitly penalized. Redox half-reactions continue to challenge many with only the stronger students being able to gain both marks and deduce the correct overall equation. Some teachers commented that the question was too demanding as students had to construct two half-equations in order to get to the overall redox equation, but the \({\text{C}}{{\text{r}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O}}_{\text{7}}^{{\text{2}} - }{\text{/C}}{{\text{r}}^{3 + }}\) half-reaction is given in table 14 of the current data booklet. The majority of candidates identified the conversion of \({{\text{I}}^ - }\) to \({\text{I}}{{\text{O}}^{3 - }}\) as oxidation and many able to identify the increase in oxidation number. The workings of a voltaic cell was generally well understood but the definition of the term standard electrode potential was often incomplete with the reference to standard conditions of the hydrogen electrode often missing.</p>
