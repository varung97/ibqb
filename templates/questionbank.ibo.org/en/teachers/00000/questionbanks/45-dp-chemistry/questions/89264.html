<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p class="p1">Reaction kinetics can be investigated using the iodine clock reaction. The equations for two reactions that occur are given below.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>Reaction A: \({{\text{H}}_2}{{\text{O}}_2}{\text{(aq)}} + {\text{2}}{{\text{I}}^ - }{\text{(aq)}} + {\text{2}}{{\text{H}}^ + }{\text{(aq)}} \to {{\text{I}}_2}{\text{(aq)}} + {\text{2}}{{\text{H}}_2}{\text{O(l)}}\)</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>Reaction B: \({{\text{I}}_2}{\text{(aq)}} + {\text{2}}{{\text{S}}_2}{\text{O}}_3^{2 - }{\text{(aq)}} \to {\text{2}}{{\text{I}}^ - }{\text{(aq)}} + {{\text{S}}_4}{\text{O}}_6^{2 - }{\text{(aq)}}\)</p>
<p class="p1">Reaction B is much faster than reaction A, so the iodine, \({{\text{I}}_{\text{2}}}\), formed in reaction A immediately reacts with thiosulfate ions, \({{\text{S}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O}}_3^{2 - }\), in reaction B, before it can react with starch to form the familiar blue-black, starch-iodine complex.</p>
<p class="p1">In one experiment the reaction mixture contained:</p>
<p class="p1">\(5.0 \pm 0.1{\text{ c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of \({\text{2.00 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) hydrogen peroxide \({\text{(}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{)}}\)</p>
<p class="p1">\(5.0 \pm 0.1{\text{ c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of 1% aqueous starch</p>
<p class="p1">\(20.0 \pm 0.1{\text{ c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of \({\text{1.00 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) sulfuric acid (\({{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{S}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{4}}}\))</p>
<p class="p1">\(20.0 \pm 0.1{\text{ c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of \({\text{0.0100 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) sodium thiosulfate (\({\text{N}}{{\text{a}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{S}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{3}}}\))</p>
<p class="p1">\(50.0 \pm 0.1{\text{ c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of water with 0.0200 &plusmn; 0.0001 g of potassium iodide (KI) dissolved in it.</p>
<p class="p1">After 45 seconds this mixture suddenly changed from colourless to blue-black.</p>

In part (c), many candidates failing to recognise that KI is rapidly reformed in the second stage of the reaction.

Calculation of uncertainty in part (g) was relatively well done by many candidates. In part (h), calculation of rate of reaction occasionally saw the erroneous use of volume in \({\text{c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\).

<p class="p1">This was a data based question based on quantitative chemistry and proved difficult for many candidates. Majority of candidates were able to gain almost full marks in parts (a) and (b). In part (c), many candidates failing to recognise that KI is rapidly reformed in the second stage of the reaction. In part (d), majority of candidates could not interpret the information correctly and hence lost two marks. Similarly, only 1 mark was obtained in part (e) where candidates recognized that iodine forms the starch-iodine complex. Many candidates managed the systematic and random errors in part (f). Calculation of uncertainty in part (g) was relatively well done by many candidates. In part (h), calculation of rate of reaction occasionally saw the erroneous use of volume in \({\text{c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\). In part (i), the candidates just repeated the stem of the question but obtained credit for the second mark for stating less frequent collisions. Part (j) was quite open ended and elicited a number of interesting responses (instead of acting as catalyst) whereas the suggested tests would not in fact confirm the hypothesis suggested. In part (k), the effect of increasing temperature on the rate of reaction proved easy for majority of candidates.</p>
