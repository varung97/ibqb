The latter is correct; the former is not accepted as it could mean anything between 1% and 99%. In (ii), many did not state the difference in behaviour of the two acids.

Almost all candidates identified phenolphthalein in (ii) correctly but in (iii) any answer that did not begin with an equation was likely to score zero. In questions such as (d) (i), candidates should avoid writing a balanced equation (and there were many) unless the actual answer is clearly indicated. Many were able to identify the stronger acid with the correct reason but in (iii) there were few successful conclusions, many not having recognized that a buffer solution was formed. In (e), most were able to explain why chlorine is in group 7, but the explanation for the period, when it was given, often omitted the idea of <em>occupied </em>shells.
