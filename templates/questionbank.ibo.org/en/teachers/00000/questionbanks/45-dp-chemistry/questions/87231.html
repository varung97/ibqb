<p>This was by far the most popular question. As before the definition was poorly done and many students defined electronegativity as just attraction for electrons or energy change in gaining an electron. However, many could at least half explain why the atomic radius decreased. In (c) some students could write a correct equation for the addition of sodium oxide to water but very few could correctly write an equation for phosphorous(V) oxide with water, following on few could then correctly state a sensible pH for the solutions formed. Suggesting methods to distinguish between strong and weak acids was reasonably well answered but many student lost marks for the imprecision in their answers. Stating "see if it conducts" and "add pH paper" were common answers without predictions of the expected results. Identification of \({\text{B}}{{\text{F}}_{\text{3}}}\) as a Lewis acid was not always explained well as students mixed up proton donation and electron pair donation. In (f) the description of the bonding and structure of sodium chloride was not well done, although there were a few strong candidates who had little problems with this question. Most candidates could correctly state the ionic formulae though. The last part of this question asked for a Lewis structure of \({\text{PC}}{{\text{l}}_{\text{3}}}\) and most did this well, although some forgot the lone pairs on the chlorine atoms. Most could then correctly state a bond angle although there were a number of candidates who stated 120&deg;. Few candidates could explain why the molecule was polar.</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>This was by far the most popular question. As before the definition was poorly done and many students defined electronegativity as just attraction for electrons or energy change in gaining an electron. However, many could at least half explain why the atomic radius decreased. In (c) some students could write a correct equation for the addition of sodium oxide to water but very few could correctly write an equation for phosphorous(V) oxide with water, following on few could then correctly state a sensible pH for the solutions formed. Suggesting methods to distinguish between strong and weak acids was reasonably well answered but many student lost marks for the imprecision in their answers. Stating "see if it conducts" and "add pH paper" were common answers without predictions of the expected results. Identification of \({\text{B}}{{\text{F}}_{\text{3}}}\) as a Lewis acid was not always explained well as students mixed up proton donation and electron pair donation. In (f) the description of the bonding and structure of sodium chloride was not well done, although there were a few strong candidates who had little problems with this question. Most candidates could correctly state the ionic formulae though. The last part of this question asked for a Lewis structure of \({\text{PC}}{{\text{l}}_{\text{3}}}\) and most did this well, although some forgot the lone pairs on the chlorine atoms. Most could then correctly state a bond angle although there were a number of candidates who stated 120&deg;. Few candidates could explain why the molecule was polar.</p>
