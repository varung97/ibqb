<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p>A group of students investigated the rate of the reaction between aqueous sodium thiosulfate and hydrochloric acid according to the equation below.</p>
<p>\[{\text{N}}{{\text{a}}_2}{{\text{S}}_2}{{\text{O}}_3}{\text{(aq)}} + {\text{2HCl(aq)}} \to {\text{2NaCl(aq)}} + {\text{S}}{{\text{O}}_2}{\text{(g)}} + {\text{S(s)}} + {{\text{H}}_2}{\text{O(l)}}\]</p>
<p>The two reagents were rapidly mixed together in a beaker and placed over a mark on a piece of paper. The time taken for the precipitate of sulfur to obscure the mark when viewed through the reaction mixture was recorded.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../../../../../../ib-questionbank-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/tinymce_asset/asset/1677/Schermafbeelding_2016-08-17_om_14.58.16.png" alt="M14/4/CHEMI/SP2/ENG/TZ2/05" /></p>
<p>Initially they measured out \({\text{10.0 c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of \({\text{0.500 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) hydrochloric acid and then added \({\text{40.0 c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of \({\text{0.0200 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) aqueous sodium thiosulfate. The mark on the paper was obscured 47 seconds after the solutions were mixed.</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p>The teacher asked the students to measure the effect of halving the concentration of sodium thiosulfate on the rate of reaction.</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p>The teacher asked the students to devise another technique to measure the rate of this reaction.</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p>Another group suggested collecting the sulfur dioxide and drawing a graph of the volume of gas against time.</p>
</div>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;'>
<p>The teacher made up \({\text{2.50 d}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of the sodium thiosulfate solution using sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate crystals, \({\text{N}}{{\text{a}}_2}{{\text{S}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{3}}} \bullet {\text{5}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O}}\). Calculate the required mass of these crystals.</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>This was quite a popular question, but responses were mixed. As in question 1, students struggled to answer questions with a strong practical context, with very few able to devise a mixture that would halve the concentration of thiosulfate, whilst keeping other concentrations constant, and responses for the need for similar beakers to be used were often too vague. Explanations of changes of rates in terms of the collision theory were generally successful but a significant number referred to the &ldquo;number&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;frequency&rdquo; of collisions. Many candidates were able to sketch Maxwell&ndash;Boltzmann distribution curves for the two temperatures, \({T_1}\) and \({T_2}\), but marks were lost due to careless omissions; the graphs did not start at the origin, were not labelled or the activation energy was missing. Many struggled to calculate the pH and many teachers have commented that this question was beyond what is expected at Standard Level and it is acknowledged that the question would have been more accessible if candidates had been asked to calculate the concentration of \({{\text{H}}^ + }\) ions and state the pH. In part (e) many students could quote and substitute into the ideal gas equation, correctly converting the temperature to Kelvin, but converting from \({{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) to \({\text{c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) posed a problem for most candidates. Although not necessary for the mark, as answers which referred to improved accuracy and precision were accepted, most candidates did not refer to the solubility of sulfur dioxide as a problem when using measuring cylinders to measure its volume.</p>
