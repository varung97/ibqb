<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p>A group of students investigated the rate of the reaction between aqueous sodium thiosulfate and hydrochloric acid according to the equation below.</p>
<p>\[{\text{N}}{{\text{a}}_2}{{\text{S}}_2}{{\text{O}}_3}{\text{(aq)}} + {\text{2HCl(aq)}} \to {\text{2NaCl(aq)}} + {\text{S}}{{\text{O}}_2}{\text{(g)}} + {\text{S(s)}} + {{\text{H}}_2}{\text{O(l )}}\]</p>
<p>The two reagents were rapidly mixed together in a beaker and placed over a mark on a piece of paper. The time taken for the precipitate of sulfur to obscure the mark when viewed through the reaction mixture was recorded.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../../../../../../ib-questionbank-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/tinymce_asset/asset/1586/Schermafbeelding_2016-08-13_om_06.28.11.png" alt="M14/4/CHEMI/HP2/ENG/TZ2/06" /></p>
<p>Initially they measured out \({\text{10.0 c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of \({\text{0.500 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) hydrochloric acid and then added \({\text{40.0 c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of \({\text{0.0200 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) aqueous sodium thiosulfate. The mark on the paper was obscured 47 seconds after the solutions were mixed.</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p>One proposed mechanism for this reaction is:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\({{\text{S}}_2}{\text{O}}_3^{2 - }{\text{(aq)}} + {{\text{H}}^ + }{\text{(aq)}} \rightleftharpoons {\text{H}}{{\text{S}}_2}{\text{O}}_3^ - {\text{(aq)}}\) &nbsp; &nbsp; Fast</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\({\text{H}}{{\text{S}}_2}{\text{O}}_3^ - {\text{(aq)}} + {{\text{H}}^ + }{\text{(aq)}} \to {\text{S}}{{\text{O}}_2}{\text{(g)}} + {\text{S(s)}} + {{\text{H}}_2}{\text{O(l)}}\) &nbsp; &nbsp; Slow</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p>The teacher asked the students to devise another technique to measure the rate of this reaction.</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p>Another group suggested collecting the sulfur dioxide and drawing a graph of the volume of gas against time.</p>

<p>This was quite a popular question, though generally not well answered. In the first part students again appeared to display a lack of expertise in a practical context with very few able to devise a mixture that would halve the concentration of thiosulfate, whilst keeping other concentrations constant, and answers predicting that this would halve the reaction time were far more commonly encountered than those doubling it. Many candidates did however suggest valid reasons why the reaction vessel should remain unchanged and a significant number of students were able to correctly deduce the rate equation that the mechanism given would predict. Again a lack of ability to interpret experimental data was evident in the fact that it was very rare to find students who realised that a graph of (time)-1 against concentration was required to be able to deduce the reaction order, with almost all simply plotting time-concentration graphs and, as a result, very few could evaluate the mechanism in the light of the experimental data. Part (c) was a fairly standard question on the effect of temperature on reaction rate, hence it was a surprise that students did not score better on it, with many of the oft repeated mistakes (number of collisions rather than collision frequency) again coming to the surface. Again it was probably inability to interpret experimental data that led to only very few students being able to correctly state the initial pH of the mixture (I am certain almost all would have gained the mark if the pH of \({\text{ 0.1 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) HCl had been asked for) and the percentage that would have to be consumed to increase the pH by one unit (which is independent of the previous answer) proved too much for almost all candidates. In part (e) most students could quote and substitute into the ideal gas equation, but converting from \({{\text{m}}^3}\) to \({\text{c}}{{\text{m}}^3}\) posed a problem for most candidates. Quite a number of candidates were however able to calculate the pH of the sulfur dioxide solution and identify a stronger acid.</p>

Again a lack of ability to interpret experimental data was evident in the fact that it was very rare to find students who realised that a graph of (time)-1 against concentration was required to be able to deduce the reaction order, with almost all simply plotting time-concentration graphs and, as a result, very few could evaluate the mechanism in the light of the experimental data. Part (c) was a fairly standard question on the effect of temperature on reaction rate, hence it was a surprise that students did not score better on it, with many of the oft repeated mistakes (number of collisions rather than collision frequency) again coming to the surface. Again it was probably inability to interpret experimental data that led to only very few students being able to correctly state the initial pH of the mixture (I am certain almost all would have gained the mark if the pH of \({\text{ 0.1 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) HCl had been asked for) and the percentage that would have to be consumed to increase the pH by one unit (which is independent of the previous answer) proved too much for almost all candidates. In part (e) most students could quote and substitute into the ideal gas equation, but converting from \({{\text{m}}^3}\) to \({\text{c}}{{\text{m}}^3}\) posed a problem for most candidates.

<p>This was quite a popular question, though generally not well answered. In the first part students again appeared to display a lack of expertise in a practical context with very few able to devise a mixture that would halve the concentration of thiosulfate, whilst keeping other concentrations constant, and answers predicting that this would halve the reaction time were far more commonly encountered than those doubling it. Many candidates did however suggest valid reasons why the reaction vessel should remain unchanged and a significant number of students were able to correctly deduce the rate equation that the mechanism given would predict.
