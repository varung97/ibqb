<p class="p1">This question was surprisingly very poorly answered. In part (a), it was distressing to see a large number of candidates who could not write the correct charge or formula of nitrate ion. In addition, the terminology appears to have confused a number of candidates and for the nature of force, ionic bonding was often stated which was incorrect, as electrostatic attraction was required. In (a) (ii), again candidates failed to answer the question and nitrate was commonly given which was not accepted. The question specifically asked for the atoms involved.</p>

<p class="p1">In part (b), the Aim 8 component of AS 3.3.2 was assessed and this was very poorly answered overall. Inevitably, owing to some overlap in assessment statements these concepts would be more familiar to those studying the Environmental Chemistry option, but undoubtedly studying other options assists in other areas, such as organic chemistry. In (b) (i), many candidates gave generic answers such as cars or factories which did not score. In (ii), many incorrect answers were given such as nitrogen oxides, hydrogen or ozone. In (iii), acid rain was frequently seen and many referred to depletion of the ozone layer. However it was extremely disappointing that many candidates gave the greenhouse effect or global warming or air pollution as the answer, which of course scored no marks.</p>
