<p>Francisco and Shamiso found that the pH of the initial \({\text{0.100 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) solution was 3.7. However, this reading was inaccurate because they forgot to wash the pH probe. Calculate the \({\text{p}}{K_{\text{a}}}\) of HQ using the reading they obtained.</p>

<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p>Most students could identify an element which would be expected to have similar properties to antimony and the reaction between its fluoride and hydrogen fluoride was generally well interpreted in terms of acid-base theories, though hardly any students realized that HF is acting as both a base (to give \({{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{F}}^ + }\)) and an acid (to give \({{\text{F}}^ - }\) which complexes with \({\text{As}}{{\text{F}}_{\text{5}}}\)). The significance of the strength of the hydrogen-halogen bond on the strength of the hydrogen halides was often appreciated though very few seemed to realize that HF hydrogen bonds to water whereas HCl does not. Many students think that weak acids require a smaller volume of alkali for neutralization than strong acids of equal concentration, though most could correctly identify an appropriate indicator for the titration and justify their choice. Most realized that sulfuric acid was dibasic, were aware of the significance of the pH at the half equivalence point and correctly identified HQ as a weak acid, though justifying this proved more of a challenge. Quite a few students gained full credit the calculation of the \({\text{p}}{K_{\text{a}}}\) from the initial pH and many gained some marks for the calculation of the pH of the buffer system.</p>

<p>Most students could identify an element which would be expected to have similar properties to antimony and the reaction between its fluoride and hydrogen fluoride was generally well interpreted in terms of acid-base theories, though hardly any students realized that HF is acting as both a base (to give \({{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{F}}^ + }\)) and an acid (to give \({{\text{F}}^ - }\) which complexes with \({\text{As}}{{\text{F}}_{\text{5}}}\)). The significance of the strength of the hydrogen-halogen bond on the strength of the hydrogen halides was often appreciated though very few seemed to realize that HF hydrogen bonds to water whereas HCl does not. Many students think that weak acids require a smaller volume of alkali for neutralization than strong acids of equal concentration, though most could correctly identify an appropriate indicator for the titration and justify their choice. Most realized that sulfuric acid was dibasic, were aware of the significance of the pH at the half equivalence point and correctly identified HQ as a weak acid, though justifying this proved more of a challenge. Quite a few students gained full credit the calculation of the \({\text{p}}{K_{\text{a}}}\) from the initial pH and many gained some marks for the calculation of the pH of the buffer system.</p>
