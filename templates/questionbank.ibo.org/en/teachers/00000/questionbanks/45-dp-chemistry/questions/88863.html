<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p>Reaction kinetics can be investigated using the iodine clock reaction. The equations for two reactions that occur are given below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Reaction A: &nbsp; &nbsp; \({{\text{H}}_2}{{\text{O}}_2}{\text{(aq)}} + {\text{2}}{{\text{I}}^ - }{\text{(aq)}} + {\text{2}}{{\text{H}}^ + }{\text{(aq)}} \to {{\text{I}}_2}{\text{(aq)}} + {\text{2}}{{\text{H}}_2}{\text{O(l)}}\)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Reaction B: &nbsp; &nbsp; \({\text{ }}{{\text{I}}_2}{\text{(aq)}} + {\text{2}}{{\text{S}}_2}{\text{O}}_3^{2 - }{\text{(aq)}} \to {\text{2}}{{\text{I}}^ - }{\text{(aq)}} + {{\text{S}}_4}{\text{O}}_6^{2 - }{\text{(aq)}}\)</p>
<p>Reaction B is much faster than reaction A, so the iodine, \({\text{I}_2}\), formed in reaction A immediately reacts with thiosulfate ions, \({{\text{S}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O}}_3^{2 - }\), in reaction B, before it can react with starch to form the familiar blue-black, starch-iodine complex.</p>
<p>In one experiment the reaction mixture contained:</p>
<p>5.0 &plusmn; 0.1 \({\text{c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of 2.00 \({\text{mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) hydrogen peroxide (\({{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{2}}}\))</p>
<p>5.0 &plusmn; 0.1 \({\text{c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of 1% aqueous starch</p>
<p>20.0 &plusmn; 0.1 \({\text{c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of 1.00 \({\text{mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) sulfuric acid (\({{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{S}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{4}}}\))</p>
<p>20.0 &plusmn; 0.1 \({\text{c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of 0.0100 \({\text{mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) sodium thiosulfate (\({\text{N}}{{\text{a}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{S}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{3}}}\))</p>
<p>50.0 &plusmn; 0.1 \({\text{c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of water with 0.0200 &plusmn; 0.0001 g of potassium iodide (KI) dissolved in it.</p>
<p>After 45 seconds this mixture suddenly changed from colourless to blue-black.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p>The activation energy can be determined using the Arrhenius equation, which is given in Table 1 of the Data Booklet. The experiment was carried out at five different temperatures. An incomplete graph to determine the activation energy of the reaction, based on these results, is shown below.</p>

<p>This question explored basic chemical concepts in the context of a practical situation. Whilst this is one frequently carried out during practical courses, none of the questions depended on prior knowledge. Students varied significantly in their ability to interpret the information given to answer parts (a) to (c), but very few could correctly carry out the propagation of uncertainties required in part (d). An encouraging number were able to carry out the rate calculation required in part (e). It was surprising how many students, though unable to identify the axes of the Arrhenius graph given in part (f), were still able to interpret it to correctly calculate the activation energy. Part (g) was deliberately open ended and elicited a number of interesting responses, though frequently the tests proposed would not in fact confirm the suggested hypothesis.</p>

Students varied significantly in their ability to interpret the information given to answer parts (a) to (c), but very few could correctly carry out the propagation of uncertainties required in part (d). An encouraging number were able to carry out the rate calculation required in part (e). It was surprising how many students, though unable to identify the axes of the Arrhenius graph given in part (f), were still able to interpret it to correctly calculate the activation energy. Part (g) was deliberately open ended and elicited a number of interesting responses, though frequently the tests proposed would not in fact confirm the suggested hypothesis.</p>
