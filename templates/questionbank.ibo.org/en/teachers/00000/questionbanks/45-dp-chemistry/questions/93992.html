<p class="p1">Option C was one of the least popular options. A surprising number did not know the purpose of the raw materials put into the blast furnace, some thinking scrap iron was a common raw material. There were few correct equations, but many would have been mark-worthy had they been balanced. Very few candidates appreciated the role of limestone or calcium oxide in neutralising the acidic impurities in iron ore, i.e. silica, and could write the equation for the formation of calcium silicate slag. Most candidates knew that reducing the carbon content of iron to form steel makes it less brittle, but a substantially lower proportion gave annealing, while others threw in tempering and quenching for good measure. Annealing continues to be a challenging notion for many students. Sections C2 and C4 of the syllabus account for 3.5 hours of study but candidates often seemed to be guessing whether the processes in question C2 used homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts. The properties of polymers were generally well known but some of the explanations were a bit thin. The solubility of Kevlar in sulphuric acid was little known but a substantial number of candidates were able to state that it is non-biodegradable, and/or that an inefficient combustion leads to the formation of pollutants. Only stronger candidates identified dioxins as pollutant. The connection with landfills was rarely seen.</p>
