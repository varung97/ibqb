<p>This was the most popular of the Section B questions, which was surprising because it was often not well answered. Most students were aware of the change involved in ionization, some realised this relates to the most easily lost electron, some that it refers to gas phase changes and a few both. Explanations of the changes in the values of successive ionization energies in terms of the attraction of the nucleus and the repulsion from other electrons were generally weak, however candidates quite often recognised that the third electron lost had to come from a more stable electron energy level. Very few were able to correctly sum the enthalpy terms involved in the Born-Haber cycle, in addition candidates rarely halved the bond enthalpy of chlorine and a significant number appeared not to realise the question referred to MgCl rather than \({\text{MgC}}{{\text{l}}_2}\). There were some G2 comments that space should have been left for students to draw a cycle, but this would have implied that such a drawing was required, hence it is better to train students to use additional paper for any background support they may require. Quite a lot of students correctly deduced the order of lattice enthalpy of the group (II) halides, and a number correctly explained this in terms of ionic radii, though many incorrectly invoked electronegativities. Many students could correctly explain the effect of pH on the solubility of \({\text{Mg(OH}}{{\text{)}}_{\text{2}}}\), though a significant number attempted to answer the opposite question; how pH would depend on the concentration of dissolved \({\text{Mg(OH}}{{\text{)}}_{\text{2}}}\)! It was surprising how few students could correctly describe metallic bonding, how it is affected by the number of delocalized electrons per cation and the way it leads to malleability. Alloys are not specifically mentioned in the syllabus but the mark scheme gave credit for answers that indicated the student was aware that malleability is associated with layers of metal atoms/cations sliding over each other. Most students were able to draw appropriately labelled diagrams of electrolysis apparatus, though sometimes the labelling of the polarity of the electrodes did not correspond to the polarity of the battery symbol drawn. Quite a few candidates could quote equations for the reactions occurring the electrodes in both the liquid and aqueous state; both seemed to be equally well answered which was perhaps a little surprisingly. Many could also give good explanations as to why electrolysis of the aqueous solution did not produce magnesium metal, though confusions in terminology (such as hydrogen rather than hydrogen ions being reduced) were not uncommon.</p>

There were some G2 comments that space should have been left for students to draw a cycle, but this would have implied that such a drawing was required, hence it is better to train students to use additional paper for any background support they may require. Quite a lot of students correctly deduced the order of lattice enthalpy of the group (II) halides, and a number correctly explained this in terms of ionic radii, though many incorrectly invoked electronegativities. Many students could correctly explain the effect of pH on the solubility of \({\text{Mg(OH}}{{\text{)}}_{\text{2}}}\), though a significant number attempted to answer the opposite question; how pH would depend on the concentration of dissolved \({\text{Mg(OH}}{{\text{)}}_{\text{2}}}\)! It was surprising how few students could correctly describe metallic bonding, how it is affected by the number of delocalized electrons per cation and the way it leads to malleability. Alloys are not specifically mentioned in the syllabus but the mark scheme gave credit for answers that indicated the student was aware that malleability is associated with layers of metal atoms/cations sliding over each other. Most students were able to draw appropriately labelled diagrams of electrolysis apparatus, though sometimes the labelling of the polarity of the electrodes did not correspond to the polarity of the battery symbol drawn. Quite a few candidates could quote equations for the reactions occurring the electrodes in both the liquid and aqueous state; both seemed to be equally well answered which was perhaps a little surprisingly. Many could also give good explanations as to why electrolysis of the aqueous solution did not produce magnesium metal, though confusions in terminology (such as hydrogen rather than hydrogen ions being reduced) were not uncommon.</p>

<p>This was the most popular of the Section B questions, which was surprising because it was often not well answered. Most students were aware of the change involved in ionization, some realised this relates to the most easily lost electron, some that it refers to gas phase changes and a few both. Explanations of the changes in the values of successive ionization energies in terms of the attraction of the nucleus and the repulsion from other electrons were generally weak, however candidates quite often recognised that the third electron lost had to come from a more stable electron energy level. Very few were able to correctly sum the enthalpy terms involved in the Born-Haber cycle, in addition candidates rarely halved the bond enthalpy of chlorine and a significant number appeared not to realise the question referred to MgCl rather than \({\text{MgC}}{{\text{l}}_2}\).
