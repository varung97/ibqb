<p>Question 7 was answered by relatively few candidates, and those who chose this question were usually not well-prepared. In (a) very few candidates indicated that HCl is a strong acid and \({\text{C}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{3}}}{\text{COOH}}\) a weak one. Many candidates seemed unfamiliar with the distinction between state and outline and simply said that HCl would be a better conductor. In (b)(i) very few candidates could state a correct equation for the reaction between ethanoic acid and sodium hydrogencarbonate, even when the formulas were provided, but most could calculate the limiting reagent in (b)(ii) and the mass of \({\text{C}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{2}}}\) produced in (b)(iii). Part (c) gave details of a volatile organic liquid. Most candidates could calculate the moles of gas present in (c)(i), although the conversion to the correct units for pressure and volume gave many problems. The calculation of the molar mass of the gas, especially with ECF applied, was generally done well by the candidates. Part (d) referred to the substitution reaction of bromoethane to form ethanol. Identifying the reagent in (d)(i) for this reaction caused problems, with many stating \({\text{O}}{{\text{H}}^ - }\) as the reagent instead of NaOH or KOH. Only the best candidates could draw the mechanism for this substitution reaction in (d)(ii). Many candidates seemed to have very little idea of how to represent an \({{\text{S}}_{\text{N}}}{\text{2}}\) mechanism. Although most candidates identified HBr as the reagent which could produce bromoethane from ethene, they often gave UV as the required condition in (e)(i). Teachers should note that assessment statement 10.6.1 indicates that reagents, conditions and equations should be included for all reaction types listed in the syllabus. Calculation of the enthalpy change using bond enthalpies did not give problems to the good candidates in (e)(ii) but many of the weaker candidates failed to identify all the bonds broken and formed, and only scored the final mark through the application of ECF. Drawing a section of a polymer produced from bromoethene in (e)(iii) presented few problems for most candidates.</p>

In (a) very few candidates indicated that HCl is a strong acid and \({\text{C}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{3}}}{\text{COOH}}\) a weak one. Many candidates seemed unfamiliar with the distinction between state and outline and simply said that HCl would be a better conductor. In (b)(i) very few candidates could state a correct equation for the reaction between ethanoic acid and sodium hydrogencarbonate, even when the formulas were provided, but most could calculate the limiting reagent in (b)(ii) and the mass of \({\text{C}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{2}}}\) produced in (b)(iii). Part (c) gave details of a volatile organic liquid. Most candidates could calculate the moles of gas present in (c)(i), although the conversion to the correct units for pressure and volume gave many problems. The calculation of the molar mass of the gas, especially with ECF applied, was generally done well by the candidates. Part (d) referred to the substitution reaction of bromoethane to form ethanol. Identifying the reagent in (d)(i) for this reaction caused problems, with many stating \({\text{O}}{{\text{H}}^ - }\) as the reagent instead of NaOH or KOH. Only the best candidates could draw the mechanism for this substitution reaction in (d)(ii). Many candidates seemed to have very little idea of how to represent an \({{\text{S}}_{\text{N}}}{\text{2}}\) mechanism. Although most candidates identified HBr as the reagent which could produce bromoethane from ethene, they often gave UV as the required condition in (e)(i). Teachers should note that assessment statement 10.6.1 indicates that reagents, conditions and equations should be included for all reaction types listed in the syllabus. Calculation of the enthalpy change using bond enthalpies did not give problems to the good candidates in (e)(ii) but many of the weaker candidates failed to identify all the bonds broken and formed, and only scored the final mark through the application of ECF. Drawing a section of a polymer produced from bromoethene in (e)(iii) presented few problems for most candidates.</p>
