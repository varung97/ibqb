<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p class="p1">Most candidates knew about the relative conductivities of magnesium chloride and phosphorous trichloride and were able to relate it to bonding. The third mark was however more problematic as many continue to equate conductivity to mobile electrons rather than ions. The pH of solutions of aqueous chlorides was not generally well known with only a small number of candidates gaining full marks. An explanation of the acidity of magnesium in terms of the charge density of the \({\text{M}}{{\text{g}}^{2 + }}\) ion proved to be particularly challenging. One teacher commented that the reaction of \({\text{PC}}{{\text{l}}_{\text{3}}}\) and water is not mentioned in the guide but it is included in the teacher note to Assessment statement 13.1.1 of the current guide (although it is not in the new guide which will be assessed for the first time in May 2016). The acidity of the period 3 oxides was generally well known but many struggled to give balanced equations to describe the reactions of sodium and phosphorous(V) oxide with water, with many confusing the reaction of sodium oxide with that of sodium giving hydrogen as a product. Most candidates were able to give correct Lewis structure and shapes and bond angles but marks were lost, as in previous session due to missing lone pairs either on the central atoms or the Br and F atoms. It should be noted that it is difficult to award ECF marks in these questions so students need to avoid careless errors. Many struggled to give a complete explanation of the polarity of the two compounds as although the molecule was identified as being asymmetrical, few stated that the P&ndash;Br and S&ndash;F bonds are polar. Only a minority of students stated that a covalent bond was an attraction between nuclei and a pair of electrons and many were unable to identify the s-orbital from hydrogen and the \({\text{p/s}}{{\text{p}}^{\text{2}}}\) orbital from carbon as the overlapping orbitals in the covalent bond. The hybridisation of oxygen was generally well known as was sigma and pi bonding.</p>

<p class="p1">Most candidates knew about the relative conductivities of magnesium chloride and phosphorous trichloride and were able to relate it to bonding. The third mark was however more problematic as many continue to equate conductivity to mobile electrons rather than ions. The pH of solutions of aqueous chlorides was not generally well known with only a small number of candidates gaining full marks. An explanation of the acidity of magnesium in terms of the charge density of the \({\text{M}}{{\text{g}}^{2 + }}\) ion proved to be particularly challenging. One teacher commented that the reaction of \({\text{PC}}{{\text{l}}_{\text{3}}}\) and water is not mentioned in the guide but it is included in the teacher note to Assessment statement 13.1.1 of the current guide (although it is not in the new guide which will be assessed for the first time in May 2016). The acidity of the period 3 oxides was generally well known but many struggled to give balanced equations to describe the reactions of sodium and phosphorous(V) oxide with water, with many confusing the reaction of sodium oxide with that of sodium giving hydrogen as a product. Most candidates were able to give correct Lewis structure and shapes and bond angles but marks were lost, as in previous session due to missing lone pairs either on the central atoms or the Br and F atoms. It should be noted that it is difficult to award ECF marks in these questions so students need to avoid careless errors. Many struggled to give a complete explanation of the polarity of the two compounds as although the molecule was identified as being asymmetrical, few stated that the P&ndash;Br and S&ndash;F bonds are polar. Only a minority of students stated that a covalent bond was an attraction between nuclei and a pair of electrons and many were unable to identify the s-orbital from hydrogen and the \({\text{p/s}}{{\text{p}}^{\text{2}}}\) orbital from carbon as the overlapping orbitals in the covalent bond. The hybridisation of oxygen was generally well known as was sigma and pi bonding.</p>
