<p>Generally candidates struggled with the details of the triglyceride structure; very few were able to gain the mark for part (a). Almost all the candidates were able to state water as the other product and gain the mark in part (b). Candidates often missed the specific details for the answer to part (c); they were able to identify the presence of double bonds or unsaturation but had difficulty expanding and linking the idea to how this changed packing and intermolecular forces. For part (d) many candidates stated hydrogenation as the answer and scored one point but many were not able to state the two reaction conditions correctly. Most responses on advantages and disadvantages of saturated fats, part (e), were too general for example, affects your health. A common statement was &lsquo;better storage/ transport&rsquo; as an advantage for saturated fats. Most candidates only scored one or two points for this question.</p>
