<h2>Question</h2>
<div class='specification'>
<p>0.100 g of magnesium ribbon is added to \({\text{50.0 c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of \({\text{1.00 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) sulfuric acid to produce hydrogen gas and magnesium sulfate.</p>
<p>\[{\text{Mg(s)}} + {{\text{H}}_2}{\text{S}}{{\text{O}}_4}{\text{(aq)}} \to {{\text{H}}_2}{\text{(g)}} + {\text{MgS}}{{\text{O}}_4}{\text{(aq)}}\]</p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p>Magnesium sulfate can exist in either the hydrated form or in the anhydrous form. Two students wished to determine the enthalpy of hydration of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. They measured the initial and the highest temperature reached when anhydrous magnesium sulfate, \({\text{MgS}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{4}}}{\text{(s)}}\), was dissolved in water. They presented their results in the following table.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../../../../../../ib-questionbank-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/tinymce_asset/asset/1655/Schermafbeelding_2016-08-16_om_10.27.16.png" alt="M14/4/CHEMI/SP2/ENG/TZ1/01.0b" /></p>
</div>

<div class='specification'>
<p>The students repeated the experiment using 6.16 g of solid hydrated magnesium sulfate, \({\text{MgS}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{4}}} \bullet {\text{7}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O(s)}}\), and \({\text{50.0 c}}{{\text{m}}^{\text{3}}}\) of water. They found the enthalpy change, \(\Delta {H_2}\), to be \( + 18{\text{ kJ}}\,{\text{mo}}{{\text{l}}^{ - 1}}\).</p>
<p>The enthalpy of hydration of solid anhydrous magnesium sulfate is difficult to determine experimentally, but can be determined using the diagram below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../../../../../../ib-questionbank-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/tinymce_asset/asset/1656/Schermafbeelding_2016-08-16_om_11.08.23.png" alt="M14/4/CHEMI/SP2/ENG/TZ1/01.c" /></p>

<p>Many candidates could sketch correct curves in (a)(i), though many did not realize that the same final volume of hydrogen is formed. Lines were generally poorly drawn with several lines for one curve, and curve I often did not join smoothly with the given curve, but dropped near the end or overshot the final volume and then fell back down. Candidates are advised to draw graphs in pencil first. In (a)(ii), very few students indicated that because the mass of hydrogen is very small it is better to measure reaction rate using gas volume; most indicated that it is not precise because the mass of a mixture is measured. It seems that very few candidates are aware that measuring loss of mass per unit time is a valid tool for determining the rate of a reaction when \({\text{C}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{2}}}\) is produced. The moles of magnesium sulfate were mostly calculated correctly in (b)(i), but in (b)(ii) most candidates had problems calculating the enthalpy change, working with the mass of magnesium sulfate instead of water or solution and not giving the enthalpy change a negative sign. Several candidates only found the temperature change and called this the enthalpy change, or found the energy change and ignored the number of moles. Few candidates correctly applied Hess&rsquo;s law in (c)(i). Some respondents felt that this was not on the SL course, but it is clearly stated in 5.3.1. Some candidates had no idea how to calculate the percentage difference in (c)(ii) and several left this blank despite a value being given for the experimental results for candidates to use if they had not found a value themselves. Quite a few others determined the percentage difference correctly. In (d) most candidates stated heat loss to the surroundings as an error, mentioning further irrelevant errors. Only the better candidates also referred to the partial hydration of the anhydrous salt. The equation for the reaction between sulfuric acid and magnesium carbonate was generally done well in (e)(i) but \({{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{C}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{3}}}\) was frequently (incorrectly) given as a product. A few candidates did not know the formulas for sulfuric acid and magnesium carbonate. Very few candidates could give a correct Lewis structure for the carbonate ion in (ii). Some almost scored but failed to include brackets and charge. Some decided that the carbonate ion was a synonym for carbon dioxide and drew that. The formula for the carbonate ion should be known (assessment statement 4.1.7) and only one Lewis structure was required so students did not need to know about resonance structures. Shape and bond angle were also done poorly but there were a few candidates who knew the shape and bond angle of the carbonate ion even though they couldn&rsquo;t draw the Lewis structure.</p>

Quite a few others determined the percentage difference correctly. In (d) most candidates stated heat loss to the surroundings as an error, mentioning further irrelevant errors. Only the better candidates also referred to the partial hydration of the anhydrous salt. The equation for the reaction between sulfuric acid and magnesium carbonate was generally done well in (e)(i) but \({{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{C}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{3}}}\) was frequently (incorrectly) given as a product. A few candidates did not know the formulas for sulfuric acid and magnesium carbonate. Very few candidates could give a correct Lewis structure for the carbonate ion in (ii). Some almost scored but failed to include brackets and charge. Some decided that the carbonate ion was a synonym for carbon dioxide and drew that. The formula for the carbonate ion should be known (assessment statement 4.1.7) and only one Lewis structure was required so students did not need to know about resonance structures. Shape and bond angle were also done poorly but there were a few candidates who knew the shape and bond angle of the carbonate ion even though they couldn&rsquo;t draw the Lewis structure.</p>

<p>Many candidates could sketch correct curves in (a)(i), though many did not realize that the same final volume of hydrogen is formed. Lines were generally poorly drawn with several lines for one curve, and curve I often did not join smoothly with the given curve, but dropped near the end or overshot the final volume and then fell back down. Candidates are advised to draw graphs in pencil first. In (a)(ii), very few students indicated that because the mass of hydrogen is very small it is better to measure reaction rate using gas volume; most indicated that it is not precise because the mass of a mixture is measured. It seems that very few candidates are aware that measuring loss of mass per unit time is a valid tool for determining the rate of a reaction when \({\text{C}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{2}}}\) is produced. The moles of magnesium sulfate were mostly calculated correctly in (b)(i), but in (b)(ii) most candidates had problems calculating the enthalpy change, working with the mass of magnesium sulfate instead of water or solution and not giving the enthalpy change a negative sign. Several candidates only found the temperature change and called this the enthalpy change, or found the energy change and ignored the number of moles. Few candidates correctly applied Hess&rsquo;s law in (c)(i). Some respondents felt that this was not on the SL course, but it is clearly stated in 5.3.1. Some candidates had no idea how to calculate the percentage difference in (c)(ii) and several left this blank despite a value being given for the experimental results for candidates to use if they had not found a value themselves. Quite a few others determined the percentage difference correctly. In (d) most candidates stated heat loss to the surroundings as an error, mentioning further irrelevant errors. Only the better candidates also referred to the partial hydration of the anhydrous salt. The equation for the reaction between sulfuric acid and magnesium carbonate was generally done well in (e)(i) but \({{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{C}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{3}}}\) was frequently (incorrectly) given as a product.
