<p>This was, by far and away, the most common choice for Section B.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conditions for an equilibrium system were well known, and the \({K_{\text{c}}}\) expression was almost universally correctly given, the incidence of curved brackets was very low. With the description of the effect of changing conditions, the increase in volume change generally scored, but the answers for the removal of ammonia were far too general to be given credit. It is pleasing to note that most candidates are aware of the importance of using the word &ldquo;'minimum&rdquo;, as well as the effect of a catalyst, with most giving perfect answers. The drawing of the Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution curve suffered from poor draughtsmanship. Too many curves did not start at the origin and lacked correct labels. An appreciable minority drew the energy/reaction co-ordinate graph. The knowledge of the compromise conditions for the Haber process was often confused, particularly with regard to why high pressure is not used, where far too many answers lacked the depth required. Occasionally the word &ldquo;pair&rdquo; was missing for the definition of a Lewis base, and with the definition of a weak Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry base most candidates failed to appreciate the difference between partially/slightly ionized and &ldquo;not completely&rdquo; ionized, the part of proton acceptor was also often missed out. With the description of the experiment to show the difference between a strong and weak base, many scored two out of the three available; the concept of a fair test, and the importance of equal concentrations was rarely appreciated.</p>
