<p>The required definition and the effect of acid on the oxidizing power of \({\text{Ti}}{{\text{O}}^{2 + }}\) was often well done, though it proved a challenge for some candidates, and most could interpret the change in terms of oxidation numbers. Very few candidates could use \({E^\Theta }\) values to predict whether a reaction with another half-cell would occur and even less could correctly combine the half-equations to produce a balanced equation for the overall reaction. Relatively few candidates managed to gain full marks for the questions relating to the voltaic cell illustrated, with the different parts appearing to be of approximately equal difficulty. The nature of the period 3 oxides was generally well appreciated, though often the effect on pH was expressed as, for example, &ldquo;basic&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;increases&rdquo;. In spite of the efficiency of modern plants many considered the contact process to be a major source of sulfur dioxide pollution, rather than combustion of coal and other &ldquo;high sulfur&rdquo; fossil fuels. The comparison of the structure of silicon dioxide to those of carbon and xenon dioxides was poorly done, the root cause often being a lack of awareness of the structure of silicon dioxide. Many candidates could however write correct equations for the reaction of silicon tetrachloride with water.</p>

<p>The required definition and the effect of acid on the oxidizing power of \({\text{Ti}}{{\text{O}}^{2 + }}\) was often well done, though it proved a challenge for some candidates, and most could interpret the change in terms of oxidation numbers. Very few candidates could use \({E^\Theta }\) values to predict whether a reaction with another half-cell would occur and even less could correctly combine the half-equations to produce a balanced equation for the overall reaction. Relatively few candidates managed to gain full marks for the questions relating to the voltaic cell illustrated, with the different parts appearing to be of approximately equal difficulty. The nature of the period 3 oxides was generally well appreciated, though often the effect on pH was expressed as, for example, &ldquo;basic&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;increases&rdquo;. In spite of the efficiency of modern plants many considered the contact process to be a major source of sulfur dioxide pollution, rather than combustion of coal and other &ldquo;high sulfur&rdquo; fossil fuels. The comparison of the structure of silicon dioxide to those of carbon and xenon dioxides was poorly done, the root cause often being a lack of awareness of the structure of silicon dioxide. Many candidates could however write correct equations for the reaction of silicon tetrachloride with water.</p>
