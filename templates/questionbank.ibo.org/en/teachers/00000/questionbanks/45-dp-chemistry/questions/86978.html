<div class='question' style='padding-left: 20px;'>
<p class="p1">Most candidates were able to give two characteristics of a dynamic equilibrium and explain the effect of changes in volume on the position of equilibrium but many had difficulty giving a complete explanation of the equilibrium shift resulting from the removal of ammonia. Candidates were expected to include a reference to the value of \({K_{\text{c}}}\) or the reduced rate of the reverse reaction when justifying their answer. The definition of activation energy was well known but some lost a mark in their explanation of catalyst action as they did not refer to an alternative pathway in their explanation for the lower activation energy. The explanation of why lower temperatures were not used in the Haber process was also incomplete with many not considering the economic disadvantages of a slow reaction rate. Similarly many did not explain why high pressure was expensive in terms of energy or building costs. Most were able to deduce the equilibrium constant but many lost a mark in the calculation of \({K_{\text{c}}}\) as they used the initial concentrations of nitrogen and hydrogen. Some teachers identified an inconsistency in the question in that the total number of moles of gas under the conditions stated in the question was not consistent with the ideal gas equation however this did not appear to be a problem for the candidates. (However, the ideal gas law cannot be applied here as under these conditions ammonia would be in its supercritical state.) Most candidates were able to define Lewis bases but the definition of weak Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry bases proved to be more problematic as many did not refer to partial ionisation in their response. Most students were able to identify the conjugate acid-base pairs. The calculation of the pH of an ammonia solution proved to be challenging with many confusing \({K_{\text{a}}}\) and \({K_{\text{b}}}\). Others did not recognize that since it is a weak base, \({\text{[N}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{3}}}{\text{]}}\) at equilibrium is approximately equal to starting concentration \({\text{(0.100 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}{\text{)}}\) or that \({\text{[NH}}{{\text{4}}^ + }{\text{]}} = {\text{[O}}{{\text{H}}^ - }{\text{]}}\). (The examination paper was rescaled for candidates sitting the examination in Spanish (due to the error in the question) and candidates close to a boundary given particular attention.) Only the strongest candidates were able to gain full marks for the pH curve although many recognised that the pH would be 1 before any ammonia was added given that HC<span class="s1">l </span>is a strong acid. A significant number had the final pH above 11 and did not allow for dilution of the \({\text{0.1 mol}}\,{\text{d}}{{\text{m}}^{ - 3}}\) ammonia solution. Many correctly identified a possible indicator.</p>

<p class="p1">Most candidates were able to give two characteristics of a dynamic equilibrium and explain the effect of changes in volume on the position of equilibrium but many had difficulty giving a complete explanation of the equilibrium shift resulting from the removal of ammonia. Candidates were expected to include a reference to the value of \({K_{\text{c}}}\) or the reduced rate of the reverse reaction when justifying their answer. The definition of activation energy was well known but some lost a mark in their explanation of catalyst action as they did not refer to an alternative pathway in their explanation for the lower activation energy. The explanation of why lower temperatures were not used in the Haber process was also incomplete with many not considering the economic disadvantages of a slow reaction rate. Similarly many did not explain why high pressure was expensive in terms of energy or building costs. Most were able to deduce the equilibrium constant but many lost a mark in the calculation of \({K_{\text{c}}}\) as they used the initial concentrations of nitrogen and hydrogen. Some teachers identified an inconsistency in the question in that the total number of moles of gas under the conditions stated in the question was not consistent with the ideal gas equation however this did not appear to be a problem for the candidates. (However, the ideal gas law cannot be applied here as under these conditions ammonia would be in its supercritical state.) Most candidates were able to define Lewis bases but the definition of weak Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry bases proved to be more problematic as many did not refer to partial ionisation in their response. Most students were able to identify the conjugate acid-base pairs.
