In questions such as (d) (i), candidates should avoid writing a balanced equation (and there were many) unless the actual answer is clearly indicated. Many were able to identify the stronger acid with the correct reason but in (iii) there were few successful conclusions, many not having recognized that a buffer solution was formed. In (e), most were able to explain why chlorine is in group 7, but the explanation for the period, when it was given, often omitted the idea of <em>occupied </em>shells.
