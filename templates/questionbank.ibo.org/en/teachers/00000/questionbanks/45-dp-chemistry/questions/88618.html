<p>Iron rusts in the presence of oxygen and water. Rusting is a redox process involving several steps that produces hydrated iron(III) oxide, \({\text{F}}{{\text{e}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{3}}} \bullet {\text{n}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O}}\), as the final product.</p>
<p>The half-equations involved for the first step of rusting are given below.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Half-equation 1: &nbsp; &nbsp; \({\text{Fe(s)}} \to {\text{F}}{{\text{e}}^{2 + }}{\text{(aq)}} + {\text{2}}{{\text{e}}^ - }\)</p>

<p>In Part (a) almost all candidates could correctly identify the equation as an oxidation reaction and justify their choice. Assigning oxidation numbers to particular species proved slightly trickier, with many not knowing that elements always have an oxidation state of zero.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Combining the half equations also provided a bit of challenge with many equations having residual electrons, though most students could correctly identify the reducing agent. The aqueous solubility of oxygen gas in Part (b) was poorly explained, with the discussion being most frequently in terms of polarity rather than invoking hydrogen bonding. The electrolysis question in Part (c) was generally well answered, though most relied on &ldquo;completing the circuit&rdquo; to obtain the salt bridge mark with few showing any comprehension of the way in which this was achieved. Both the property responsible for the ordering of the periodic table and the relationship of electronic structure to position in the periodic table, required for Part (d), were well known and it was rare for a student not to gain full marks. Similarly in Part (e), most students correctly drew the curve that would result from a more effective catalyst. Many also seemed to be aware of the basic idea of how to find the reaction rate, though correct use of the terms &ldquo;tangent&rdquo; and &ldquo;gradient&rdquo; was rare and many failed to note it referred to &ldquo;initial rate&rdquo;. Most students could also identify an appropriate alternative method for monitoring the rate. In the final section most students could accurately label the axes of a Maxwell-Boltzmann curve and many could also use it to explain the effect of a catalyst, though some weaker students confused this with the effect of temperature and constructed a second curve.</p>
