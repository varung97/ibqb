<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Overview of essential ideas for this topic.</strong></p>
<p>8.1:&nbsp;The constant need for new energy sources implies decisions that may have a serious effect on the environment. The finite quantity of fossil fuels and their implication in global warming has led to the development of alternative sources of energy. This continues to be an area of rapidly changing technological innovation.</p>
<p>8.2:&nbsp;For simplified modelling purposes the Earth can be treated as a black-body radiator and the atmosphere treated as a grey-body.</p>
