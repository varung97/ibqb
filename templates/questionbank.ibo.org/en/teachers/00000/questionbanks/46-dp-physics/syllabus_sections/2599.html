<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Overview of the essential ideas for this topic</strong></p>
<p>4.1:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>A study of oscillations underpins many areas of physics with simple harmonic motion (shm), a fundamental oscillation that appears in various natural phenomena.</p>
<p>4.2:&nbsp;There are many forms of waves available to be studied. A common characteristic of all travelling waves is that they carry energy, but generally the medium through which they travel will not be permanently disturbed.</p>
<p>4.3:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>All waves can be described by the same sets of mathematical ideas. Detailed knowledge of one area leads to the possibility of prediction in another.</p>
<p>4.4:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Waves interact with media and each other in a number of ways that can be unexpected and&nbsp;useful.</p>
<p>4.5:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>When travelling waves meet they can superpose to form standing waves in which energy may not be transferred.</p>
