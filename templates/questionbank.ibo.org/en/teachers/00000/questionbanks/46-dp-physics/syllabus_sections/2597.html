<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Overview of the essential ideas for this topic</strong></p>
<p>2.1: Motion may be described and analysed by the use of graphs and equations.</p>
<p>2.2:&nbsp;Classical physics requires a force to change a state of motion, as suggested by Newton in his laws of motion.</p>
<p>2.3:&nbsp;The fundamental concept of energy lays the basis upon which much of science is built.</p>
<p>2.4:&nbsp;Conservation of momentum is an example of a law that is never violated.</p>
