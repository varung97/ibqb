<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Overview of essential ideas for this option.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A.1:&nbsp;Einstein&rsquo;s study of electromagnetism revealed inconsistencies between the theory of Maxwell and Newton's mechanics. He recognized that both theories could not be reconciled and so choosing to trust Maxwell&rsquo;s theory of electromagnetism he was forced to change long-cherished ideas about space and time in mechanics.</p>
<p>A.2:&nbsp;Observers in relative uniform motion disagree on the numerical values of space and time coordinates for events, but agree with the numerical value of the speed of light in a vacuum. The Lorentz transformation equations relate the values in one reference frame to those in another. These equations replace the Galilean transformation equations that fail for speeds close to that of light.</p>
<p>A.3:&nbsp;Spacetime diagrams are a very clear and illustrative way to show graphically how different observers in relative motion to each other have measurements that differ from each other.</p>
