<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Overview of the essential ideas for this topic</strong></p>
<p>3.1:&nbsp;Thermal physics deftly demonstrates the links between the macroscopic measurements essential to many scientific models with the microscopic properties that underlie these models.</p>
<p>3.2:&nbsp;The properties of ideal gases allow scientists to make predictions of the behaviour of real gases.</p>
