<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Overview of the essential ideas for this topic.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>10.1:&nbsp;Electric charges and masses each influence the space around them and that influence can be represented through the concept of fields.</p>
<p>10.2:&nbsp;Similar approaches can be taken in analysing electrical and gravitational potential problems.</p>
