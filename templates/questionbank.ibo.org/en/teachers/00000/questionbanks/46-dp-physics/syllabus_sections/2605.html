<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Overview of the essential ideas for this topic.</strong></p>
<p>9.1:&nbsp;The solution of the harmonic oscillator can be framed around the variation of kinetic and potential energy in the system.</p>
<p>9.2:&nbsp;Single-slit diffraction occurs when a wave is incident upon a slit of approximately the same size as the wavelength.</p>
<p>9.3:&nbsp;Interference patterns from multiple slits and thin films produce accurately repeatable patterns.</p>
<p>9.4:&nbsp; Resolution places an absolute limit on the extent to which an optical or other system can separate images of objects.</p>
<p>9.5:&nbsp;The Doppler effect describes the phenomenon of wavelength/frequency shift when relative motion occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
