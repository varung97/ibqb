<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Overview of the essential ideas for this topic</strong></p>
<p>1.1: Since 1948, the Syst&egrave;me International d&rsquo;Unit&eacute;s (SI) has been used as the preferred language of science and technology across the globe and reflects current best measurement practice.</p>
<p>1.2:&nbsp;Scientists aim towards designing experiments that can give a &ldquo;true value&rdquo; from their measurements, but due to the limited precision in measuring devices, they often quote their results with some form of uncertainty.</p>
<p>1.3:&nbsp;Some quantities have direction and magnitude, others have magnitude only, and this understanding is the key to correct manipulation of quantities. This sub-topic will have broad applications across multiple fields within physics and other sciences.</p>
