<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Overview of the essential ideas for this topic</strong></p>
<p>5.1: When charges move an electric current is created.</p>
<p>5.2:&nbsp;One of the earliest uses for electricity was to produce light and heat. This technology continues to have a major impact on the lives of people around the world.</p>
<p>5.3:&nbsp;Electric cells allow us to store energy in a chemical form.</p>
<p>5.4:&nbsp;The effect scientists call magnetism arises when one charge moves in the vicinity of another moving charge.</p>
