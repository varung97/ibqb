<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Overview of the essential ideas for this topic.</strong></p>
<p>4.1:&nbsp;The continued survival of living organisms including humans depends on sustainable communities.</p>
<p>4.2:&nbsp;Ecosystems require a continuous supply of energy to fuel life processes and to replace energy lost as heat.</p>
<p>4.3:&nbsp;Continued availability of carbon in ecosystems depends on carbon cycling.</p>
<p>4.4:&nbsp; Concentrations of gases in the atmosphere affect climates experienced at the Earth&rsquo;s surface.</p>
