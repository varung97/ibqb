<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Overview of the essential ideas for this topic.</strong></p>
<p>2.1: Living organisms control their composition by a complex web of chemical reactions.</p>
<p>2.2: Water is the medium of life.</p>
<p>2.3:&nbsp;Compounds of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are used to supply and store energy.</p>
<p>2.4:&nbsp;Proteins have a very wide range of functions in living organisms.</p>
<p>2.5: Enzymes control the metabolism of the cell.</p>
<p>2.6:&nbsp;The structure of DNA allows efficient storage of genetic information.</p>
<p>2.7:&nbsp;Genetic information in DNA can be accurately copied and can be translated to make the proteins needed by the cell.</p>
<p>2.8:&nbsp;Cell respiration supplies energy for the functions of life.</p>
<p>2.9:&nbsp;Photosynthesis uses the energy in sunlight to produce the chemical energy needed for life.</p>
