<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Overview of the essential ideas for this topic.</strong></p>
<p>6.1:&nbsp;The structure of the wall of the small intestine allows it to move, digest and absorb food.</p>
<p>6.2:&nbsp;The blood system continuously transports substances to cells and simultaneously collects waste products.</p>
<p>6.3:&nbsp;The human body has structures and processes that resist the continuous threat of invasion by pathogens.</p>
<p>6.4:&nbsp;The lungs are actively ventilated to ensure that gas exchange can occur passively.</p>
<p>6.5:&nbsp;Neurons transmit the message, synapses modulate the message.</p>
<p>6.6:Hormones are used when signals need to be widely distributed.</p>
