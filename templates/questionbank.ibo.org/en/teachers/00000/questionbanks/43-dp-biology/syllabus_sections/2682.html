<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Overview of the essential ideas for this topic.</strong></p>
<p>3.1:&nbsp;Every living organism inherits a blueprint for life from its parents.</p>
<p>3.2:&nbsp;Chromosomes carry genes in a linear sequence that is shared by members of a species.</p>
<p>3.3:&nbsp;Alleles segregate during meiosis allowing new combinations to be formed by the fusion of gametes.</p>
<p>3.4: The inheritance of genes follows patterns.</p>
<p>3.5: Biologists have developed techniques for artificial manipulation of DNA, cells and organisms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
